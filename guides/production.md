# Moving to Production Guide

## What is this?

Once you feel that your application is ready to be deployed to the Real Worldâ„¢, you
will want to move it to __Production Environment__.

## Requesting the production keys

Moving your application to Production Environment means requesting a
__production key__, but don't be scared! The process is very straight forward:

1. [Sign in](https://developers.amadeus.com/login) to your account
2. Click on your username (top right corner)
3. Go to [My Self-Service Workspace](https://developers.amadeus.com/my-apps)
4. Select the application that you want to move to Production and click on `Get Production environment` button:

![request_prod](../images/request_production_key.png)

Moving to __production environment__ involves 3 steps:

1. Information about you and your app
2. Payment information (credit card or bank transfer)
3. Signing the terms and conditions (via DocuSign)

Once you have completed the steps above, you will receive a copy of your contract by email.

At this point your application's status will show __pending__:

Once your application is validated you will be notified and the application's status will change to __live__:

> Please note that the process can take up to 72 hours for your first application. Additional applications will __not__ require any waiting time.

Remember that once you reach the threshold of free transactions, you will automatically be billed on a monthly basis, for each transaction. You can easily manage and track your app usage in [My
Self-Service Workspace](https://developers.amadeus.com/my-apps).

## Using the new production keys

Once you get your production key you will need to change your source code to:

- replace the base URL for your API calls to point
to `https://api.amadeus.com` instead of `https://test.api.amadeus.com`
- change your `API key` and `API secret` to your new ones

If you are using our [SDKs]('https://github.com/amadeus4dev'), just initialise the client as follows:

```python

amadeus = Client(client_id='YOUR_PRODUCTION_CLIENT_ID',
                 client_secret='YOUR_PRODUCTION_CLIENT_SECRET',
                 hostname='production')
```


Congrats! Your application is ready to disrupt the travel industry!
