Types of errors There two main types of errors are: Client : typically occur when the request has not been properly built. Server : occur when there is an issue on the server side. Client errors If your API request is invalid, you will receive a Client Error response with an HTTP 4xx status code.

The Self-Service offer targets independent developers and start-ups that wish to connect to Amadeus APIs in a quick and easy manner. You can access and start testing these new REST/JSON APIs in less than 3 minutes, and get quick access to production data with a flexible pay-as-you-go pricing model. Please note that the catalog includes some selected APIs only, although we will be constantly releasing new APIs. The Enterprise offer provides access to the full Amadeus APIs catalog, tailored to companies with scaling needs as well as the leading brands in the travel industry. Customers of Enterprise APIs receive dedicated support from their account managers and enjoy a customized pricing scheme to meet their needs. Please note that access to Enterprise APIs is only granted on a request basis, and some special requirements may apply. Our Enterprise commercial teams will be happy to guide you through the process. Can I use APIs from both Self-Service and Enterprise? Yes, you can use APIs from both catalogs, but please keep in mind that the requirements and conditions of each offer are very different. Please check our Get Started guide for more information. Self-Service APIs Is there a test environment to try the Self-Service APIs? Yes! You can try Self-Service APIs in our test environment and enjoy a free monthly request quota to build and test your app. If you exceed this free request quota in the test environment, you'll receive a 429 error code in JSON and not be able to call the APIs. If you need to increase the number of monthly API calls, please consider moving your application to production. It's a quick and easy process and you will keep the free request quota you enjoyed in test. Once you reach your threshold in production, you will simply pay for the additional API calls you make. How do I access the Self-Service APIs documentation? Check our Amadeus for Developers docs portal for links to interactive reference documentation for each API and helpful guides covering topics such as authorization, pagination and common errors. On the Amadeus for Developers GitHub page , you can also find code samples and SDKs. Do you provide SDKs? Yes! On the Amadeus for Developers GitHub page you can find open-source SDKs in various languages. Alternatively, you can use OpenAPI Generator to create an SDK from our OpenAPI files . Where can I see code examples for Amadeus Self-Service APIs? Code examples for all Amadeus Self-Service APIs are available in our GitHub . How do I make my first Self-Service API call? On the Get Started with Self-Service APIs page you can find information on creating an account, getting your API key and making your first call. How do I move Self-Service APIs from test to production? To launch your application to production, please follow the steps described in our Moving to production guide. You will be asked to sign a contract and provide billing information before receiving your new API key. When you move to production, you will maintain the same free monthly request quota you enjoyed in test. When you reach your monthly threshold, you will be billed for the additional API calls you make at the rates shown on our Pricing page . How do I delete my application built using Self-Service APIs? To delete an application, visit the My apps section of your My Self-Service Workspace . Remember that deleted apps cannot be recovered. Will you include more APIs in the Self-Service catalog? We are constantly expanding our Self-Service API catalog with new APIs from all travel segments such as flights, hotels, cars or destination content. If you have any specific requests or feedback regarding APIs that you would like to add to your catalog, please contact us. We'd love to hear from you! What are the terms of service for Amadeus Self-Service APIs? To find out more about our terms and conditions for the test environment, please visit our Terms and Conditions page . If you are already in production, you should have received an email with the legal terms regulating API usage in the production environment. If you have not received this information, please contact us . I am not a travel agent and have no experience in the travel industry, can I still use the Self-Service APIs? Our Self-Service offer is designed for newcomers to Amadeus, there are no prerequisites. Any developer who wishes to connect to Amadeus travel data can do so in a quick and easy way via our Self-Service offer. For more details, please check our Get Started guide . API keys What is an API key? An API key is a unique reference number which identifies your application to Amadeus. The API key is part of the authorization process and must be sent with each API request. If you have multiple applications using Amadeus APIs, each application must have its own API key. For more details, check our Authorization guide . Your API keys are also used to track usage. To avoid unwanted charges, please do no share or post them in public repositories. For more information, see this article on best practices for secure API key storage . How do I get my Self-Service API key? To get a Self-Service API key, simply create an account in the Amadeus for Developers portal . Next, visit the My Self-Service Workspace area and create your first application. An API key will be generated automatically. Remember, your API key is private and should not be shared publicly. Why is my Self-Service API key not working? If your API key is not working, please verify that it is the same exact key that was provided in the My Self-Service Workspace . Please keep in mind that we automatically revoke API keys that are publicly searchable. This is done to protect users against unwanted usage bills. As a general rule, you should not put your API keys in the source code you commit to GitHub or other public repositories. Instead, you should store your keys as environment variables rather than hard-coding them in your script. For more information, see this article on best practices for secure API key storage . How long is my Self-Service access token valid for? The access token is valid for 1800 seconds (30mins). If you get an authentication fail, please request a new token. Can I use my API key in a public repository? Storing your API keys or any other sensitive information in a public repository must be avoided at all costs to prevent malicious access to your APIs, which could result in unwanted usage bills. In order to protect our users, we automatically revoke API keys that are publicly searchable. We recommend that you store your keys as environment variables rather than hard-coding them in your script. For more information, see this article on best practices for secure API key storage . Why has my API key been revoked? We automatically revoke publicly searchable API keys to prevent unwanted charges to your account. To prevent this from happening, you should read your API key from a system environment variable rather than putting it in the source code you commit to GitHub. If you need to get a new API key, please go to My Self-Service Workspace . Billing How is billing calculated for Self-Service APIs? It is free to test and prototype with Self-Service APIs and you will enjoy a free monthly request quota in both the test and production environments. When you exceed your free request quota in production, you will be billed for the additional calls you make at the rates indicated on our Pricing page , with no additional fees. Please note that prices vary from one API to another. You can check your monthly usage and select your preferred payment method (credit card or bank transfer) in your Self-Service Workspace. How do I request a refund of my Self-Service usage bill? If you're a Self-Service API user, please send your refund requests via the contact us and our team will carefully analyse them. You will be notified if your refund is approved and be reimbursed within the following days (please note that refund processing times may vary depending on your bank). Test collection Is there a limit to the calls I can make to Self-Service APIs in the test environment? Yes, each Self-Service API in test includes a limited number of free monthly calls. This free request quota varies from one API to another and it applies to the sum of all your applications. If you exceed the quota in test, you'll receive a 429 error code in JSON. To see how many free requests remain, log into your account and check your API usage & quota in your Workspace area. Please keep in mind that it can take up to 12 minutes for data to appear. Your free request quota should be sufficient for testing purposes. If you need to increase your number of monthly API calls, please consider moving your application to production. The process is quick and simple and you will keep the free request quotas you enjoyed in test. What should I do if I'm about to reach my Self-Service free request quota limit? The test environment is designed for testing purposes. Every month, you'll receive a free request quota to build and test your app. If you need to increase your number of monthly API calls, please move your application to production. The process is quick and easy, and you will keep the free monthly request quota you enjoyed in test. Once you exceed your quota in production, you will be billed for the additional API calls you make. Is there a limit to the calls I can make to Self-Service APIs in the production environment? There is no consumption limit in production, as long as there are no outstanding usage bills and your account's payment method is up to date. Why do I get a 429 error in JSON if I have some free calls left? After making API call, it can take up to 12 minutes for the data to appear on your usage & quota page. If you are nearing your limit free request quota limit and receive a 429 error, it's likely that you have run out of free calls. To keep using the APIs, you can either move your app to production or wait until the free request quota is reset at the beginning of each month. Why do I get an error code 429 when I call a Self-Service API? This error indicates you carried out too many requests and went over your limit of free calls for this API. If you wish to keep using the APIs, you can either move your app to production and enter your preferred payment method or alternatively wait until the following month to get more free calls. Is the data returned in the Self-Service test environment accurate? The information returned in test environment is from limited data collections . This is done as a security measure to protect our data and our customers. When you move to production, you will get access to complete and live data. Flight Inspiration Search Why didn't I get any results for Flight Inspiration Search? This API works with cached data in the test environment and not all airports are cached. You can find a list of airports included in the cached data in our guides section. When combining these searches with the Airport Nearest Relevant API, it is better to search using the city code rather than the airport code. Airport Nearest Relevant API Why isn't the Airport Nearest Relevant API returning a specific airport near me? This may be because an airport is near a national boarder. If so, please check the API parameters for location. Also, please keep in mind that our Airport Nearest Relevant API excludes private and military airports. Flight Create Orders API How are tickets issued for flights booked with Flight Create Orders in Self-Service? For Self-Service users, ticketing must be done via airline consolidator. Airline consolidators are essentially air ticket wholesalers that have special arrangements with airlines and, among other functions, can serve as host agencies for travel agents without the necessary IATA/ARC certifications necessary to issue tickets. To access Flight Create Orders in production, you must have a contract signed with a consolidator for ticket issuance. If you need help finding a consolidator, please contact our support team to put in touch with the best consolidator in your region. How can I retrieve booking made with Flight Create Orders in Self-Service? You can consult booking made through Flight Create Orders using the Flight Order Management API. This API works using a unique identifier(the flight offer id) that is returned by the Flight Create Orders API. Does Amadeus pay a commission for flights booked with Flight Create Orders in Self-Service? Generally, Amadeus does not offer booking commissions for Self-Service users. Airline consolidators What is an airline consolidator? Airlines consolidators are wholesalers of air tickets. They usually partner with airlines to get negotiated rates for air tickets, and then resell the air tickets to travel agents or consumers. Many airlines consolidators act as host agencies for retail travel agencies or online travel agency startups that do not have the license from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to issue air tickets. To issue air tickets via airline consolidators, the travel startups have to settle commercial agreements with the airline consolidators in the markets in which they want to operate. It is to be noted that not all the airline consolidators provide post-ticketing services such as monitoring and notifying travel agencies about schedule changes and flight cancellations. This is something that startups have to check with their potential airline consolidators. How are payments handled with my consolidator? Different airline consolidators handle payments in different ways. In some cases, you will be asked to make an initial deposit to cover future ticketing charges. In other cases, you will be billed monthly for the services consumed. Please contact our support team or refer to your airline consolidator contract for more details. How do I handle cancellations, changes and post-booking services for bookings made with Flight Create Orders in Self-Service? For Self-Service users, all post-booking services must be handled offline with the consolidator you work with for ticket issuance. In general, these actions can be made while the Passenger Name Record (PNR) is queued for ticketing (before the ticket is issued), though their availability once a ticket has issued depends largely on the consolidator and the clauses of your agreement. How do I handle refunds for flights booked with Flight Create Orders in Self-Service? Refunds must be handled offline directly with your consolidator. Technical support What kind of support does Amadeus for Developers offer? There are two different support paths available based on our two different offer: Self-Service and Enterprise. Self-Service users have at their disposal detailed documentation, guides and SDKs, to help them solve any doubts they may have. Check the Self-Service Docs page for more information. For any other Self-Service support queries, such as billing issues or a refund request, please go to the support section and click on contact us about Self-Service support.

The following APIs currently support pagination: Safe Place Points of Interest Airport Nearest Relevant Airport & City Search Hotel Search v2 Flight Most Travelled Destinations Flight Most Booked Destinations Accessing paginated results Using SDKs Amadeus for Developers SDKs make it simple to access paginated results.

Click on Register . Complete the form using a valid email address and click on the Create account button. An automatic confirmation email will be sent to the email address you provided. In the confirmation email you receive, click on Activate your account . You can now log in to the portal with your new credentials! Welcome to Amadeus for Developers ! Step 2: Get your API key To start using the APIs, you need to tell the system that you are allowed to do so. This process is called authorization. Danger Remember that the API Key and API Secret are for personal use only. Do not share them with anyone. All you need to do, is to attach an alphanumeric string called token to your calls. This token will identify you as a valid user. Each token is generated from two parameters: API Key and API Secret . Once your account has been verified, you can get your API key and API Secret by following these steps: Sign in to the Developers Portal . Click on your username (located in the top right corner of the Developers portal page) Go to My Self-Service Workspace . Click on Create New App button. Enter your application details and click on Create . Important Test environment At this stage, you are using the testing environment, where you will enjoy a fixed number of free API call quotas per month for all your applications. When you reach the limit, you will receive an error message. This environment will help you build and test your app for free and get ready for deploying it to the market. Step 3: Calling the API For our first call, let's get a list of possible destinations from Paris for a maximum amount of 200 EUR using the Flight Inspiration Search API , which returns a list of destinations from a given origin along with the cheapest price for each destination. Creating the Request Before making your first API call, you need to get your access token . For security purposes, we implemented the oauth2 process that will give you an access token based on your API Key and API Secret. To retrieve the token , you need to send a POST request to the endpoint /v1/security/oauth2/token with the correct Content-Type header and body. Replace {client_id} with your API Key and {client_secret} with your API Secret in the command below and execute it: 1 2 3 curl \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ -d \"grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}\" Warning Please take a look at our Authorization guide to understand how the process works in depth.

Click on Register . Complete the form using a valid email address and click on the Create account button. An automatic confirmation email will be sent to the email address you provided. In the confirmation email you receive, click on Activate your account . You can now log in to the portal with your new credentials! Welcome to Amadeus for Developers !","title":"Step 1: Create an account"},{"location":"quick-start/#step-2-get-your-api-key","text":"To start using the APIs, you need to tell the system that you are allowed to do so. This process is called authorization. Danger Remember that the API Key and API Secret are for personal use only. Do not share them with anyone. All you need to do, is to attach an alphanumeric string called token to your calls. This token will identify you as a valid user. Each token is generated from two parameters: API Key and API Secret . Once your account has been verified, you can get your API key and API Secret by following these steps: Sign in to the Developers Portal . Click on your username (located in the top right corner of the Developers portal page) Go to My Self-Service Workspace . Click on Create New App button. Enter your application details and click on Create . Important Test environment At this stage, you are using the testing environment, where you will enjoy a fixed number of free API call quotas per month for all your applications.

OAuth generates an access token which grants the client permission to access a protected resource. The method to acquire a token is called grant . There are different types of OAuth grants . Amadeus for Developers uses the Client Credentials Grant . Requesting an access token Once you have created an app and received your API Key and API Secret , you can generate an access token by sending a POST request to the authorization server: https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token/ Information Remember that your API Key and API Secret should be kept private. Read more about best practices for secure API key storage . The body of the request is encoded as x-www-form-urlencoded , where the keys and values are encoded in key-value tuples separated by '&', with a '=' between the key and the value: Key Value grant_type The value client_credentials client_id The API Key for the application client_secret The API Secret for the application Specify the type of the request using the content-type HTTP header with the value application/x-www-form-urlencoded . The following example uses cURL to request a new token: 1 2 3 curl \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ -d \"grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}\" Note that the -X POST parameter is not needed in the cURL command. As we are sending a body, cURL sends the request as POST automatically. Response The authorization server will respond with a JSON object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 { \"type\" : \"amadeusOAuth2Token\" , \"username\" : \"foo@bar.com\" , \"application_name\" : \"BetaTest_foobar\" , \"client_id\" : \"3sY9VNvXIjyJYd5mmOtOzJLuL1BzJBBp\" , \"token_type\" : \"Bearer\" , \"access_token\" : \"CpjU0sEenniHCgPDrndzOSWFk5mN\" , \"expires_in\" : 1799 , \"state\" : \"approved\" , \"scope\" : \"\" } The response will contain the following parameters: Parameter Description type The type of resource. The value will be amadeusOAuth2Token . username Your username (email address). application_name The name of your application. client_id The API Key for your application token_type The type of token issued by the authentication server. The value will be Bearer . access_token The token to authenticate your requests. expires_in The number of seconds until the token expires. state The status of your request. Values can be approved or expired . Using the token Once the token has been retrieved, you can authenticate your requests to Amadeus Self-Service APIs. Each API call must contain the authorization HTTP header with the value Bearer {access_token} , where acess_token is the token you have just retrieved. The following example is a call to the Flight Check-in Links API to retrieve the check-in URL for Iberia ( IB ): 1 2 curl \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/reference-data/urls/checkin-links?airline=IB\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer CpjU0sEenniHCgPDrndzOSWFk5mN\" Managing tokens from your source code To retrieve a token using your favourite programming language, send a POST request and parse the JSON response as in the cURL examples above. There are different strategies to maintain your token updated, like checking the time remaining until expiration before each API call or capturing the unauthorized error when the token expires. In both cases, you must request a new token. To simplify managing the authentication process, you can use the Amadeus for Developers SDKs available on GitHub. The SDKs automatically fetch and store the access_token and set the headers in all API calls. Example of initializing the client and authenticating with the Node SDK: 1 2 3 4 5 6 var Amadeus = require ( 'amadeus' ); var amadeus = new Amadeus ({ clientId : '[API Key]' , clientSecret : '[API Secret]' }); You can then call the API. The following example is a call to the Flight Check-in Links API to retrieve the check-in URL for Iberia ( IB ): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 var Amadeus = require ( 'amadeus' ); var amadeus = new Amadeus ({ clientId : '[API Key]' , clientSecret : '[API Secret]' }); amadeus . referenceData . urls . checkinLinks . get ({ airlineCode : 'IB' }). then ( function ( response ){ console . log ( response . data ); }). catch ( function ( responseError ){ console . log ( responseError . code ); });","title":"Authorization"},{"location":"API-Keys/authorization/#authorizing-your-application","text":"Amadeus for Developers uses OAuth to authenticate access requests.

This guide will help you migrate to the new version of the Hotel Search API and leverage its advantages right from the start. How is the Hotel Search API v3 different to v2.1? The main difference between the two API versions is that the v2.1 endpoint /shopping/hotel-offers/by-hotel has been integrated into the v3 /shopping/hotel-offers/ endpoint . All hotel offers in the Hotel Search v3 are now queried by hotel\u2019s unique Amadeus Id, which renders the v2.1 endpoint /shopping/hotel-offers/by-hotel obsolete. We also have a new API to help you ensure a seamless migration \u2013 the Hotel List API . This API returns a list of hotels by a unique Amadeus hotel Id, IATA city code or geographic coordinates. The diagram below shows a high-level overview of the differences between the Hotel Search API v2.1 and v3. Now let\u2019s have a closer look at the differences on the parameters level. GET /shopping/hotel-offers New required query parameters Parameter Description hotelIds Amadeus property codes on 8 chars. This parameter was an optional query parameter in v2.1. adults Number of adult guests (1-9) per room. This parameter was an optional query parameter in v2.1.

Use case inspirations You can easily integrate the new Hotel Search API in your hotel booking engine or combine it with other APIs in our Hotel category, such as the Hotel Ratings API or Hotel Name Autocomplete API . Whatever your use case might be, the Amadeus Self-Service APIs will help your business achieve the competitive advantage in the travel industry. FAQ How can I get the hotel image/address/contact details/rating/amenities? Due to legal constraints we, unfortunately, can no longer distribute hotel images and specific details through our Self-Service APIs. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. If you need a workaround in the meantime, we recommend using Leonardo , our trusted data provider. How can I use the data without the cache data control? The Hotel Search API v3 is using live data directly while avoiding the need to build cache and add any extra validation mechanisms to the data. How do I get the hotel rating? We offer data on hotel rating via our Hotel Rating API. Please bear in mind that this rating information is based on the sentiment analysis and not the star rating system. You can, however, retrieve a list of hotels by their star rating using the Hotel List API with the required star rating as an additional query parameter.","title":"Hotel search"},{"location":"migration-guides/hotel-search/#how-is-the-hotel-search-api-v3-different-to-v21","text":"The main difference between the two API versions is that the v2.1 endpoint /shopping/hotel-offers/by-hotel has been integrated into the v3 /shopping/hotel-offers/ endpoint .

With the successful rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme and the continuous improvement of testing technology, public health safety measures have been continuously refined.\u202f To keep up with these developments, we have expanded the scope of the Travel Restrictions API to ensure that our customers get the most relevant information on the latest\u202fCOVID-19 safety and travel\u202fregulations. In this blog post, we would like to highlight the most notable additions to the original API. How to use Travel Restrictions API The new edition of the Travel Restrictions API is located in the same Self-Service and Enterprise catalogues. If you are already using the Travel Restrictions API , just change the prefix of the base URL from v1 to v2. If you are new to the Travel Restrictions API : Sign-up for a free account Create a new project in your Self-Service Workspace to get your API key Follow the steps in our Authentication Guide to generate your access token Make your first call using the API reference or the tool of your choice. In our test environment, you\u2019ll have access to sample data and 200 free requests per month to build your app, with live data available once you move to production. To help you along the way, you can also check out our client libraries and code samples on GitHub and get support straight from the Amadeus developer relations team on Discord. Get responses in multiple languages The new Travel Restrictions API can show the search results in several languages. This is enabled by the new query parameter language, which currently supports English (EN), Spanish (ES), French (FR), German (DE), Japanese (JA), Korean (KO), Thai (TH), Bahasa (ID), and Chinese (ZH). New object for travel test conditions and rules We have redesigned the entire object related to the test conditions and rules to expand it with more detailed information on COVID-19 testing. All testing-related information is now aggregated into a single object travelTestConditionsAndRules . The travelTestConditionsAndRules object is divided into the string travelPhases and the object scenarios. The travelPhases indicates the phase of the travel to which the test conditions and rules apply, such as \"before travel\", \"upon travel\" etc. The scenarios drills further down into the travel specifics. Each scenario is identified by the string name and contains two objects: condition - this is the travel test condition in terms of what type of traveller needs a test and for what kind of trip. rule - this is the travel test rule in terms of exemptions, test type and validity period. What is included in the travel test conditions? The condition object contains three items: traveller - the Travel Test Traveller condition, defined by the string whoNeeds (indicating the type of traveller who needs to take a test) and the string minimumAge (indicating the minimum age to take a test). trip - the Travel Test Trip condition, defined by the object countries and the strings destinationCountry (IATA code), destinationCity (city name), transitCountry (IATA code), transitCity (IATA code). textualScenario - the free text string to describe the travel scenario. The object countries is essentially defined by another object \u2013 Area , which gives a more precise description of the place that the traveller goes to. The Area contains the strings name (which indicates the name of the area), code (IATA code of the area), areaType (such as country, city, region etc.; as you see, the Area is not limited to only countries) and the object geoCode , which contains the integers latitude (in the range from -90 to 90) and longitude (in the range from -180 to 180). What is included in the travel test rules? The rule object contains three items: exemptions \u2013 this string describes any applicable exemptions to the tests. test - the Travel Test Requirements Rules object, which contains the string types (indicating the test types) and the object validity , containing the strings delay (validity period for the test) and referenceDateTime (reference date and time for the test validity period). arrivalTestDays - this string indicates the time period to take a test upon arrival. New object for declaration documents We have also added an object that provides information on the traveller\u2019s health insurance requirements. This is now defined by a dedicated object healthInsurance , which contains the strings isRequired (showing whether a health insurance is required for this trip), minAmount (minimum coverage of the insurance, if required), currencyCode (insurance coverage currency) and text for any additional comments. Additional information on banned travellers The Entry schema now contains a list of travellers banned from entering a particular area. This is reflected in the bannedTravellers string. Additional data on disease infection A new string trend has been added to the Disease Infection dataset. This trend compares the infection rate from the latest week to that of the previous week. This can be \u201cSignificant Decrease\u201d, \u201cSignificant Increase\u201d, \u201cDecrease\u201d, \u201cIncrease\u201d or \u201cSteady\u201d. We can now also see any additional comments in the text string. New object for travel vaccination The Travel Vaccination object has been expanded with a new object qualifiedVaccines and the integer minimumAge (indicating the minimum age, in years, to get a vaccine; no vaccine is required for persons under this age). The qualifiedVaccines object contains the following items: supportedVaccineProducts - a string for the vaccine\u2019s short name. numberOfDoses - an integer defining the number of doses required for full vaccination. expiration - an object containing the strings expiresAfter and referenceDateTime defining the vaccine\u2019s expiration date. boosterRequired - a string showing whether a booster shot is required. boosterExpiration - an object containing the strings expiresAfter and referenceDateTime , which define the booster\u2019s expiration date. validity - an object containing the strings delay and referenceDateTime , which define the validity period and reference date and time for the vaccine. New object for area health passes A new object AreaHealthPass contains information about the health pass required for a specific area. This object contains the following items: isRequired - a string that indicates whether a health pass is required for this area. applicationGuidance - a string that explains what activities and establishments require a health pass. obtentionMethods - a string that explains how to obtain a health pass. referenceLink - a string for a URL to the health pass rules, web portal or app landing page. lastUpdate - the last date of the health pass update. text - a string for any additional comments. We have also renamed several existing parameters to provide more clarity about their purpose. Get the most out of your travel safety data To get the most out of the new Travel Restrictions API , we recommend combining it with other Amadeus APIs. For example, if you are planning a journey, you can use the Flight Offers Search API and the Hotel List API to explore the tickets and accommodation options. Once you know where to go and where to stay, reach out to the Travel Restrictions API for any advice on the latest\u202fCOVID-19 safety and travel\u202frequirements that are relevant to your plan and maximise the safety of your journey by running your destination choice by the Safe Place API. Collaboration and technology are key to drive our industry towards a brighter future. Together, let\u2019s rebuild travel.","title":"Travel restrictions"},{"location":"migration-guides/travel-restrictions/#introducing-the-travel-restrictions-api-v2-get-more-travel-safety-data","text":"Many things have changed in the travel industry since we introduced our Travel Restrictions API in the summer of last year.

APIs Description Points of Interest Find the best sights, shops, and restaurants in any city or neighborhood. Tours and Activities Find the best tours, activities, and tickets in any city or neighborhood. Includes a deep link to book with the provider. These two APIs have the same behavior. You can search by radius or by a square, and retrieve results by ID. Let's go through them one by one. Show Travelers the best sights, shops, and restaurants The Points of Interest API relies on AVUXI\u2019s GeoPopularity algorithm, which analyses and ranks geolocated data from more than 60 sources, including comments, photos, and reviews from millions of users. Search by radius The first endpoint supports only GET method and returns a list of points of interest for a given location - latitude and longitude - and a radius (1 km by default). The following sample returns a list of Points of Interest for someone geolocated in Barcelona downtown: 1 curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/pois?latitude = 41 .397158 & longitude = 2 .160873 In case we want to expand the area of search, we could use the radius parameter. In the following example, we increase the radius to 3 kilometers: 1 curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/pois?latitude = 41 .397158 & longitude = 2 .160873 & radius = 3 Search by a square The second endpoint works in a similar way to the radius-based endpoint. It also supports GET operations but it defines the area of search by a square: North, West, South, and East. The following example returns a list of points of interest for an area around Barcelona: 1 curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/pois/by-square?north = 41 .397158 & west = 2 .160873 & south = 41 .394582 & east = 2 .177181 Response For both endpoints you can expect the same response format - a list of locations with the following JSON structure: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subType\" : \"POINT_OF_INTEREST\" , \"id\" : \"AF57D529B2\" , \"self\" : { \"href\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/pois/AF57D529B2\" , \"methods\" : [ \"GET\" ] }, \"geoCode\" : { \"latitude\" : 41.40359 , \"longitude\" : 2.17436 }, \"name\" : \"La Sagrada Familia\" , \"category\" : \"SIGHTS\" , \"rank\" : 5 , \"tags\" : [ \"church\" , \"sightseeing\" , \"temple\" , \"sights\" , \"attraction\" , \"historicplace\" , \"tourguide\" , \"landmark\" , \"professionalservices\" , \"latte\" , \"activities\" , \"commercialplace\" ] } Type and subType are literals with fixed values. id is a unique value for this point of interest, which you can use in the next endpoint. geoCode is a structure that contains geolocation information: latitude and longitude of the location. name contains the string identifying the location. category corresponds to the category of the location and could be one of the following values: SIGHTS, BEACH_PARK, HISTORICAL, NIGHTLIFE, RESTAURANT, or SHOPPING. rank is the position compared to other locations based on how famous a place is, with 1 being the highest. tags field is a list of words related to that location, which comes directly from the different sources of data analyzed. Retrieve by Id You can also keep the unique Id of each point of interest and retrieve it with the last endpoint as below. 1 curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/pois/AF57D529B2 Offer tours, activities, and attraction tickets The Tours and Activities API is built in partnership with MyLittleAdventure. Tours and Activities API enables you to offer users the best activities in any destination, complete with a photo, description, price, and link to book the activity directly with the provider. For the API, we partnered with MyLittleAdventure which aggregates offers from over 45 of the world\u2019s top activity platforms, such as Viator, GetYourGuide, Klook and Musement and applies an algorithm to identify duplicate activities across providers, compare them and return the best one. You can now help your users find the best things to do in over 8,000 destinations worldwide and book more than 300,000 unique activities including sightseeing tours, day trips, skip-the-line museum tickets, food tours, hop-on-hop-off bus tickets and much more. This API has the same design as other endpoints, such as the Points of Interest API. Search by radius You can search activities for a specific location by providing a latitude and longitude. The API returns activities within a 1km radius, but you can also define a custom radius. 1 curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/activities/longitude = -3.69170868 & latitude = 40 .41436995 & radius = 1 Search by a square You can search activities within a given area by providing the coordinates: North, West, South, and East. 1 curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/activities/by-square?north = 41 .397158 & west = 2 .160873 & south = 41 .394582 & east = 2 .177181 Response Let\u2019s look at a sample response from the Tours and Activities API: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 { \"data\" : [ { \"id\" : \"23642\" , \"type\" : \"activity\" , \"self\" : { \"href\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/activities/23642\" , \"methods\" : [ \"GET\" ] }, \"name\" : \"Skip-the-line tickets to the Prado Museum\" , \"shortDescription\" : \"Book your tickets for the Prado Museum in Madrid, discover masterpieces by Vel\u00e1zquez, Goya, Mantegna, Raphael, Tintoretto and access all temporary exhibitions.\" , \"geoCode\" : { \"latitude\" : \"40.414000\" , \"longitude\" : \"-3.691000\" }, \"rating\" : \"4.500000\" , \"pictures\" : [ \"https://images.musement.com/cover/0001/07/prado-museum-tickets_header-6456.jpeg?w=500\" ], \"bookingLink\" : \"https://b2c.mla.cloud/c/QCejqyor?c=2WxbgL36\" , \"price\" : { \"currencyCode\" : \"EUR\" , \"amount\" : \"16.00\" } } ] } As you can see, the API returns a unique activity Id along with the activity name, short description, geolocation, customer rating, image, price and deep link to the provider page to complete the booking.

Airlines Flight Check-in Links Simplifies the check-in process by providing direct links to the airline check-in page. Airline Code Lookup Finds the name of an airline by its IATA or ICAO airline codes. Airline Routes Finds all destinations served by a given airline. Search flights Search to get flight inspirations The Flight Inspiration Search API provides a list of destinations from a given airport that is searched by the IATA code of the origin, ordered by price and filtered by departure date, one-way/round-trip, trip duration, connecting flights or maximum price. Information The Flight Inspiration Search API uses dynamic cache data. This cache data is created daily based on the most trending options that are derived from past searches and bookings. In this way, only the most trending options are included in the response. The only mandatory query parameter is the IATA code of the origin as in the following example request that retrieves a list of destinations from Boston: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin = BOS The departure date is an optional parameter, which needs to be provided in the YYYY-MM-DD format: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin = BOS & departureDate = 2022 -12-12 If the oneWay parameter set to true , only one way flight options will be provided in the response. Alternatively, if the oneWay parameter set to false , the search results will show round-trip flights. Otherwise, both flight options will be included in the results. For example, the following request shows one-way flights out of Boston: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin = BOS & oneWay = true One-way journeys can be optionally refined by the journey duration provided in days with the duration parameter: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin = BOS & oneWay = true & duration = 2 The nonStop parameter filters the search query to direct flights only: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin = BOS & nonStop = true If you need to cap the maximum ticket price, just specify the maximum price in decimals using the maxPrice parameter: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin = BOS & maxPrice = 100 Information This API returns cached prices. Once a destination is chosen, use the Flight Offers Search API to get real-time pricing and availability. The API provides a link to the Flight Offers Search API to search for flights once a destination is chosen and a link to the Flight Cheapest Date Search API to check the cheapest dates to fly: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-destination\" , \"origin\" : \"BOS\" , \"destination\" : \"CHI\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2022-07-22\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2022-07-28\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"52.18\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDates\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin=BOS&destination=CHI&departureDate=2022-07-02,2022-12-28&oneWay=false&duration=1,15&nonStop=false&maxPrice=300&currency=USD&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=BOS&destinationLocationCode=CHI&departureDate=2022-07-22&returnDate=2022-07-28&adults=1&nonStop=false&maxPrice=300&currency=USD\" } } ] Search for destinations for a specific duration of stay For example, let's say a traveler wants to spend six days in a city but doesn't have a strong preference for the destination. With the Flight Inspiration Search API we can recommend the traveler the cheapest destinations based on the stay duration. This can be done using the parameter viewBy which returns flight destinations by DATE , DESTINATION , DURATION , WEEK , or COUNTRY . In our scenario we need to pass the value DURATION to the parameter viewBy , like in the example below. Also, as input we give a duration of six days and origin Miami. The departure date will be between the 1st and 3rd of September 2021. GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?departureDate=2021-09-01,2021-09-03&duration=6&origin=MIA&viewBy=DURATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 { \"type\" : \"flight-destination\" , \"origin\" : \"MIA\" , \"destination\" : \"MSP\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2021-09-01\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2021-09-07\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"136.79\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDates\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin=MIA&destination=MSP&departureDate=2021-09-01,2021-09-03&oneWay=false&duration=6&nonStop=false&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=MIA&destinationLocationCode=MSP&departureDate=2021-09-01&returnDate=2021-09-07&adults=1&nonStop=false\" } }, { \"type\" : \"flight-destination\" , \"origin\" : \"MIA\" , \"destination\" : \"STT\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2021-09-02\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2021-09-08\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"137.36\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDates\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin=MIA&destination=STT&departureDate=2021-09-01,2021-09-03&oneWay=false&duration=6&nonStop=false&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=MIA&destinationLocationCode=STT&departureDate=2021-09-02&returnDate=2021-09-08&adults=1&nonStop=false\" } } As you can see, all the recommendations have a duration of six days and are sorted by the lowest price. The API also provides link to the Flight Offers Search API for each result in order to check for available flights. Search for cheapest flights regardless of the dates The Flight Cheapest Date Search API finds the cheapest dates to travel from one city to another. The API provides a list of flight options with dates and prices, and allows you to order by price, departure date or duration. Information The Flight Cheapest Date Search API uses dynamic cache data. This cache data is created daily based on the most trending options that are derived from past searches and bookings. In this way, only the most trending options are included in the response. Information This API returns cached prices. Once the dates are chosen, use the Flight Offers Search API to get real-time pricing and availability. The origin and destination are the two mandatory query parameters: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin = MAD & destination = MUC We can further refine our search query by the departure dates, one-way/round-trip, trip duration, connecting flights or maximum price. The API supports one or multiple departure dates in the query provided the dates are speficied in the ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD format and separated by a comma: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin = BOS & destination = CHI & departureDate = 2022 -08-15,2022-08-28 If the oneWay parameter set to true , only one way flight options will be provided in the response. Alternatively, if the oneWay parameter set to false , the search results will show round-trip flights. Otherwise, both flight options will be included in the results. For example, the following request shows one-way flights out of Boston: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin = BOS & oneWay = true One-way journeys can be optionally refined by the journey duration provided in days with the duration parameter: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin = BOS & oneWay = true & duration = 2 The nonStop parameter filters the search query to direct flights only: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin = BOS & nonStop = true If you need to cap the maximum ticket price, just specify the maximum price in decimals using the maxPrice parameter: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin = BOS & maxPrice = 100 The API provides a link to the Flight Offers Search API to search for flights once a destination is chosen, in order to proceed with the booking flow. Search for best flight offers The Flight Offers Search API searches over 500 airlines to find the cheapest flights for a given itinerary. The API lets you search flights between two cities, perform multi-city searches for longer itineraries and access one-way combinable fares to offer the cheapest options possible. For each itinerary, the API provides a list of flight offers with prices, fare details, airline names, baggage allowances and departure terminals. Warning Flights from low-cost carriers and American Airlines are currently unavailable. The Flight Offers Search API starts the booking cycle with a search for the best fares. The API returns a list of the cheapest flights given a city/airport of departure, a city/airport of arrival, the number and type of passengers and travel dates. The results are complete with airline name and fares as well as additional information, such as bag allowance and pricing for additional baggage. The API comes in two flavors: Simple version: GET operation with few parameters but which is quicker to integrate. On steroids: POST operation offering the full functionalities of the API. The minimum GET request has following mandatory query parameters: IATA code for the origin location IATA code for the destination location Departure date in the ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD format Number of adult travellers 1 GET https://test.api.amadus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?adults = 1 & originLocationCode = BOS & destinationLocationCode = CHI & departureDate = 2022 -07-22 Let's have a look at all the optional parameters that we can use to refine the search query. One or more of these parameters can be used in addition to the mandatory query parameters. Return date in the ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD format, same as the departure date: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode = BOS & destinationLocationCode = CHI & departureDate = 2022 -07-22 & returnDate = 2022 -07-26 & adults = 1 Number of children travelling, same as the number of adults: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode = BOS & destinationLocationCode = CHI & departureDate = 2022 -07-26 & adults = 1 & children = 1 Number of infants travelling, same as the number of adults: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode = BOS & destinationLocationCode = CHI & departureDate = 2022 -07-26 & adults = 1 & infants = 1 Travel class, which includes economy, premium economy, business or first: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode = BOS & destinationLocationCode = CHI & departureDate = 2022 -07-26 & adults = 1 & travelClass = ECONOMY We can limit the search to a specific airline by providing its IATA airline code, such as BA for the British Airways: https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=BOS&destinationLocationCode=CHI&departureDate=2022-07-26&adults=1&includedAirlineCodes=BA Alternatively, we can exclude an airline from the search in a similar way: https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=BOS&destinationLocationCode=CHI&departureDate=2022-07-26&adults=1&excludedAirlineCodes=BA The nonStop parameter filters the search query to direct flights only: https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=BOS&destinationLocationCode=CHI&departureDate=2022-07-26&adults=1&nonStop=true The currencyCode defines the currency in which we will see the offer prices: https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=BOS&destinationLocationCode=CHI&departureDate=2022-07-26&adults=1&currencyCode=EUR We can limit the maximum price to a certain amount and specify the currency as described above: https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=BOS&destinationLocationCode=CHI&departureDate=2022-07-26&adults=1&maxPrice=500&currencyCode=EUR The maximum number of results retrieved can be limited using the max parameter in the search query: https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=BOS&destinationLocationCode=CHI&departureDate=2022-07-26&adults=1&max=1 The API returns a list of flight-offer objects (up to 250), including information such as itineraries, price, pricing options, etc. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" , \"id\" : \"1\" , \"source\" : \"GDS\" , \"instantTicketingRequired\" : false , \"nonHomogeneous\" : false , \"oneWay\" : false , \"lastTicketingDate\" : \"2022-07-02\" , \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"itineraries\" : [ ], \"price\" : { \"currency\" : \"EUR\" , \"total\" : \"22.00\" , \"base\" : \"13.00\" , \"fees\" : [ { \"amount\" : \"0.00\" , \"type\" : \"SUPPLIER\" }, { \"amount\" : \"0.00\" , \"type\" : \"TICKETING\" } ], \"grandTotal\" : \"22.00\" } } ] The POST endpoint consumes JSON data in the format described below. So, instead of constructing a search query, we can specify all the required parameters in the payload and pass it onto the API in the request body. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 { \"currencyCode\" : \"USD\" , \"originDestinations\" : [ { \"id\" : \"1\" , \"originLocationCode\" : \"RIO\" , \"destinationLocationCode\" : \"MAD\" , \"departureDateTimeRange\" : { \"date\" : \"2022-11-01\" , \"time\" : \"10:00:00\" } }, { \"id\" : \"2\" , \"originLocationCode\" : \"MAD\" , \"destinationLocationCode\" : \"RIO\" , \"departureDateTimeRange\" : { \"date\" : \"2022-11-05\" , \"time\" : \"17:00:00\" } } ], \"travelers\" : [ { \"id\" : \"1\" , \"travelerType\" : \"ADULT\" }, { \"id\" : \"2\" , \"travelerType\" : \"CHILD\" } ], \"sources\" : [ \"GDS\" ], \"searchCriteria\" : { \"maxFlightOffers\" : 2 , \"flightFilters\" : { \"cabinRestrictions\" : [ { \"cabin\" : \"BUSINESS\" , \"coverage\" : \"MOST_SEGMENTS\" , \"originDestinationIds\" : [ \"1\" ] } ], \"carrierRestrictions\" : { \"excludedCarrierCodes\" : [ \"AA\" , \"TP\" , \"AZ\" ] } } } } Search for flights including or excluding specific airlines If you want your search to return flights with only specified airlines, you can use the parameter includedAirlineCodes to consider specific airlines. For example, there is a traveler who wants to travel from Berlin to Athens only with Aegean Airlines (A3): GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?max=3&adults=1&includedAirlineCodes=A3&originLocationCode=BER&destinationLocationCode=ATH&departureDate=2022-12-06 With the parameter excludedAirlineCodes you can ignore specific airlines. For example, there is a traveler who wants to travel from Berlin to Athens ignoring both Aegean Airlines (A3) and Iberia (IB): GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?max=3&adults=1&excludedAirlineCodes=A3,IB&originLocationCode=BER&destinationLocationCode=ATH&departureDate=2021-09-06 Search for the best flight option The Flight Choice Prediction API predicts the flight your users will choose. Our machine-learning models have analyzed historical interactions with the Flight Offers Search API and can determine each flight\u2019s probability of being chosen. Boost conversions and create a personalized experience by filtering out the noise and showing your users the flights which are best for them. Here is a quick cURL example piping the Flight Offers Search API results directly to the prediction API. Let\u2019s look at flight offers for a Madrid-New York round trip (limiting to four options for this test illustration) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 curl --request GET \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\ --url https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers \\? origin \\= MAD \\& destination \\= NYC \\& departureDate \\= 2019 -08-24 \\& returnDate \\= 2019 -09-19 \\& adults \\= 1 \\ | curl --request POST \\ --header 'content-type: application/json' \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\ --url https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers/prediction --data @- The prediction API returns the same content as the Low Fare search with the addition of the choiceProbability field for each flight offer element. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 { \"data\" : [ { \"choiceProbability\" : \"0.9437563627430908\" , \"id\" : \"1558602440311-352021104\" , \"offerItems\" : [ ... ], \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" }, { \"choiceProbability\" : \"0.0562028823257711\" , \"id\" : \"1558602440311--1831925786\" , \"offerItems\" : [ ... ], \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" }, { \"choiceProbability\" : \"0.0000252425060482\" , \"id\" : \"1558602440311-480701674\" , \"offerItems\" : [ ... ], \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" }, { \"choiceProbability\" : \"0.0000155124250899\" , \"id\" : \"1558602440311--966634676\" , \"offerItems\" : [ ... ], \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" } ], \"dictionaries\" : { ... } }, \"meta\" : { ... } } } Search for flight offers for multiple cities Many travelers take advantage of their international trips to visit several destinations. Multi-city search is a functionality that lets you search for consecutive one-way flights between multiple destinations in a single request. The returned flights are packaged as a complete, bookable itinerary. To perform multi-city searches, you must use the POST method of the Flight Offers Search API . The API lets you search for up to six origin and destination city pairs. In the following example, we\u2019ll fly from Madrid to Paris, where we\u2019ll spend a couple of days, then fly to Munich for three days. Next, we\u2019ll visit Amsterdam for two days before finishing our journey with a return to Madrid. We'll use the following IATA city codes: MAD > PAR > MUC > AMS > MAD The request will look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers \\ -d '{ \u202f\u202f\"originDestinations\": [ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f{ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"id\":\u202f\"1\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"originLocationCode\":\u202f\"MAD\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"destinationLocationCode\":\u202f\"PAR\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"departureDateTimeRange\": { \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"date\":\u202f\"2022-10-03\" \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f} \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f}, \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f{ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"id\":\u202f\"2\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"originLocationCode\":\u202f\"PAR\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"destinationLocationCode\":\u202f\"MUC\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"departureDateTimeRange\": { \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"date\":\u202f\"2022-10-05\" \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f} \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f}, \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f{ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"id\":\u202f\"3\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"originLocationCode\":\u202f\"MUC\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"destinationLocationCode\":\u202f\"AMS\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"departureDateTimeRange\": { \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"date\":\u202f\"2022-10-08\" \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f} \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f}, \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f{ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"id\":\u202f\"4\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"originLocationCode\":\u202f\"AMS\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"destinationLocationCode\":\u202f\"MAD\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"departureDateTimeRange\": { \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"date\":\u202f\"2022-10-11\" \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f} \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f} \u202f\u202f], \u202f\u202f\"travelers\": [ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f{ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"id\":\u202f\"1\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"travelerType\":\u202f\"ADULT\", \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"fareOptions\": [ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"STANDARD\" \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f] \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f} \u202f\u202f], \u202f\u202f\"sources\": [ \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"GDS\" \u202f\u202f], \u202f\u202f\"searchCriteria\": { \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\"maxFlightOffers\":\u202f1 \u202f\u202f} }' Search using loyalty programs The Flight Offers Price API and the Seatmap Display API both accept Frequent Flyer information so end-users can benefit from their loyalty program. When adding Frequent Flyer information, please remember that each airline policy is different, and some require additional information, such as passenger name, email or phone number to validate the account. If the validation fails, your user won\u2019t receive their loyalty program advantages. Search for routes from a specific airport The Airport Routes API shows all destinations from a given airport. To follow up on our previous example, let's check where we can fly to from Madrid (MAD). The options are obviously quite broad, so we can limit the maximum number of results to 10. Keep in mind that this limit will apply from the beginning of the results list in the alphabetical order of the airport IATA codes. The request will look like this: 1 2 3 curl --request GET \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\ --url https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/airport/direct-destinations?departureAirportCode = MAD & max = 10 \\ So we can see the the following results: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 { \"meta\" : { \"count\" : 10 , \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/airport/direct-destinations?departureAirportCode=MAD&max=10\" } }, \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"ALBACETE\" , \"iataCode\" : \"ABC\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"LANZAROTE\" , \"iataCode\" : \"ACE\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"MALAGA\" , \"iataCode\" : \"AGP\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"ALGHERO\" , \"iataCode\" : \"AHO\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"ALICANTE\" , \"iataCode\" : \"ALC\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"ALGIERS\" , \"iataCode\" : \"ALG\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"AMMAN\" , \"iataCode\" : \"AMM\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"AMSTERDAM\" , \"iataCode\" : \"AMS\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"ASUNCION\" , \"iataCode\" : \"ASU\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"ATHENS\" , \"iataCode\" : \"ATH\" } ] } Search for routes for a specific airline The Airline Routes API shows all destinations for a given airline. To follow up on our previous example, let's check what destinations the British Airways fly to. There's definitely plenty of options, so we can limit the maximum number of results to two for the sake of simplicity. Keep in mind that this limit will apply from the beginning of the results list in the alphabetical order of the city names. The request will look like this: 1 2 3 curl --request GET \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\ --url https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/airline/destinations?airlineCode = BA & max = 2 \\ So we can see the the following results: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"Bangalore\" , \"iataCode\" : \"BLR\" }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subtype\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"Paris\" , \"iataCode\" : \"PAR\" } ], \"meta\" : { \"count\" : \"2\" , \"sort\" : \"iataCode\" , \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/airline/destinations?airlineCode=BA&max=2\" } } } Look up the airline ICAO code by the IATA code If we need to know the IATA code for a particular airline but only have the airline's ICAO code, the Airline Code Lookup API can help us out. Just specify the IATA code in the query and send out the request: 1 2 3 curl --request GET \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\ --url https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/airlines?airlineCodes = BA \\ The response is pretty straightforward: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 { \"meta\" : { \"count\" : 1 , \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/airlines?airlineCodes=BA\" } }, \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"airline\" , \"iataCode\" : \"BA\" , \"icaoCode\" : \"BAW\" , \"businessName\" : \"BRITISH AIRWAYS\" , \"commonName\" : \"BRITISH A/W\" } ] } Search for flight and fare availability With the Flight Availabilities Search API you can check the flight and fare availability for any itinerary. This refers to the full inventory of fares available for an itinerary at any given time. The concept of flight availability originated in the early days of flight booking as a way for agents to check what options existed for their travelers\u2019 itineraries. Here\u2019s an example request for a one-way flight from Mad (MIA) to Atlanta (ATL) for one traveler departing on December 12, 2021: POST https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/availability/flight-availabilities 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 { \"originDestinations\" : [ { \"id\" : \"1\" , \"originLocationCode\" : \"MIA\" , \"destinationLocationCode\" : \"ATL\" , \"departureDateTime\" : { \"date\" : \"2021-11-01\" } } ], \"travelers\" : [ { \"id\" : \"1\" , \"travelerType\" : \"ADULT\" } ], \"sources\" : [ \"GDS\" ] } The response contains a list of available flights matching our request criteria (for the sake of this example, we only show the first result). Each flight availability includes descriptive data about the flight and an availabilityClasses list containing the available fare classes and the number of bookable seats remaining in each fare class. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-availability\" , \"id\" : \"1\" , \"originDestinationId\" : \"1\" , \"source\" : \"GDS\" , \"instantTicketingRequired\" : false , \"paymentCardRequired\" : false , \"duration\" : \"PT1H54M\" , \"segments\" : [ { \"id\" : \"1\" , \"numberOfStops\" : 0 , \"blacklistedInEU\" : false , \"departure\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"MIA\" , \"at\" : \"2021-11-01T05:30:00\" }, \"arrival\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"ATL\" , \"terminal\" : \"S\" , \"at\" : \"2022-11-01T07:24:00\" }, \"carrierCode\" : \"DL\" , \"number\" : \"2307\" , \"aircraft\" : { \"code\" : \"321\" }, \"operating\" : {}, \"availabilityClasses\" : [ { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"J\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"C\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"D\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"I\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"Z\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"W\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"Y\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"B\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"M\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"H\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"Q\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"K\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"L\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"U\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"T\" }, { \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 9 , \"class\" : \"E\" } ] } ] }, Note that airlines\u2019 bookable seat counters goe up to a maximum of 9, even if more seats are available in that fare class. If there are less than 9 bookable seats available, the exact number is displayed. Search branded fares Branded fares are airfares that bundle tickets with extras, such as checked bags, seat selection, refundability or loyalty points accrual. Each airline defines and packages its own branded fares and they vary from one airline to another. Branded fares not only help build brand recognition and loyalty, but also offer travelers an attractive deal as the incremental cost of the fare is usually less than that of buying the included services \u00e0 la carte. The Branded Fares Upsell API receives flight offers from the Flight Offers Search API and returns branded fares as flight offers which can be easily passed to the next step in the booking funnel. The booking flow is the following: Search for flights using the Flight Offers Search API . Find branded fare options for a selected flight using the Branded Fares Upsell API . Confirm the fare and get the final price using the Flight Offers Price API . Book the flight using the Flight Create Orders API . Let's see an example of how to search for branded fares. You can build the request by passing the flight-offer object from the Flight Offers Search API into the body of the POST request: 1 POST https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-offers/upselling 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 { \"data\" : { \"type\" : \"flight-offers-upselling\" , \"flightOffers\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" , \"id\" : \"1\" , \"source\" : \"GDS\" , \"instantTicketingRequired\" : false , \"nonHomogeneous\" : false , \"oneWay\" : false , \"lastTicketingDate\" : \"2022-06-12\" , \"numberOfBookableSeats\" : 3 , \"itineraries\" : [ { \"duration\" : \"PT6H10M\" , \"segments\" : [ { \"departure\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"MAD\" , \"terminal\" : \"1\" , \"at\" : \"2022-06-22T17:40:00\" }, \"arrival\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"FCO\" , \"terminal\" : \"1\" , \"at\" : \"2022-06-22T20:05:00\" }, \"carrierCode\" : \"AZ\" , \"number\" : \"63\" , \"aircraft\" : { \"code\" : \"32S\" }, \"operating\" : { \"carrierCode\" : \"AZ\" }, \"duration\" : \"PT2H25M\" , \"id\" : \"13\" , \"numberOfStops\" : 0 , \"blacklistedInEU\" : false }, { \"departure\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"FCO\" , \"terminal\" : \"1\" , \"at\" : \"2022-06-22T21:50:00\" }, \"arrival\" : { \"iataCode\" : \"ATH\" , \"at\" : \"2022-06-23T00:50:00\" }, \"carrierCode\" : \"AZ\" , \"number\" : \"722\" , \"aircraft\" : { \"code\" : \"32S\" }, \"operating\" : { \"carrierCode\" : \"AZ\" }, \"duration\" : \"PT2H\" , \"id\" : \"14\" , \"numberOfStops\" : 0 , \"blacklistedInEU\" : false } ] } ], \"price\" : { \"currency\" : \"EUR\" , \"total\" : \"81.95\" , \"base\" : \"18.00\" , \"fees\" : [ { \"amount\" : \"0.00\" , \"type\" : \"SUPPLIER\" }, { \"amount\" : \"0.00\" , \"type\" : \"TICKETING\" } ], \"grandTotal\" : \"81.95\" , \"additionalServices\" : [ { \"amount\" : \"45.00\" , \"type\" : \"CHECKED_BAGS\" } ] }, \"pricingOptions\" : { \"fareType\" : [ \"PUBLISHED\" ], \"includedCheckedBagsOnly\" : false }, \"validatingAirlineCodes\" : [ \"AZ\" ], \"travelerPricings\" : [ { \"travelerId\" : \"1\" , \"fareOption\" : \"STANDARD\" , \"travelerType\" : \"ADULT\" , \"price\" : { \"currency\" : \"EUR\" , \"total\" : \"81.95\" , \"base\" : \"18.00\" }, \"fareDetailsBySegment\" : [ { \"segmentId\" : \"13\" , \"cabin\" : \"ECONOMY\" , \"fareBasis\" : \"OOLGEU1\" , \"class\" : \"O\" , \"includedCheckedBags\" : { \"quantity\" : 0 } }, { \"segmentId\" : \"14\" , \"cabin\" : \"ECONOMY\" , \"fareBasis\" : \"OOLGEU1\" , \"brandedFare\" : \"ECOLIGHT\" , \"class\" : \"O\" , \"includedCheckedBags\" : { \"quantity\" : 0 } } ] } ] } ] } } You can see the process step to step in this video tutorial. Search for personalized destination recommendations The Travel Recommendations API provides personalized destinations based on the traveler's location and an input destination, such as a previously searched flight destination or city of interest. For example, for a traveler based in San Francisco who has searched for multiple flights to Barcelona, what other similar destinations the API could recommend? The API takes as input the country of the traveler and the IATA code of the city that was searched, in our case this will be US and BCN respectively. GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/recommended-locations?cityCodes=BCN&travelerCountryCode=US The response will look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 { \"type\" : \"flight-date\" , \"origin\" : \"SFO\" , \"destination\" : \"ROM\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2021-09-19\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2021-09-23\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"348.75\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDestinations\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin=SFO&departureDate=2021-04-15,2021-10-11&oneWay=false&duration=1,15&nonStop=false&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=SFO&destinationLocationCode=ROM&departureDate=2021-09-19&returnDate=2021-09-23&adults=1&nonStop=false\" } } If you want to take it to the next level, you can call the Flight Cheapest Date Search API to let the users know not only the recommended destinations but also what are the cheapest dates to visit any of these cities. For real-time flights, you can also call the Flight Offers Search API . The Travel Recommendations API has returned links to both APIs. Search for recommended nearby destinations With the Airport Nearest Relevant API you can find the closest major airports to a starting point. By default, results are sorted by relevance but they can also be sorted by distance , flights , travelers using the parameter sort . Information To get the latitude and longitude of a city you can use the Airport & City Search API using the city's IATA code. Let's call the Airport Nearest Relevant API to find airports within the 500km radius of Madrid. GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/airports?latitude=40.416775&longitude=-3.703790&radius=500 A part of the response looks like: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subType\" : \"AIRPORT\" , \"name\" : \"AIRPORT\" , \"detailedName\" : \"BARCELONA/ES:AIRPORT\" , \"timeZoneOffset\" : \"+02:00\" , \"iataCode\" : \"BCN\" , \"geoCode\" : { \"latitude\" : 41.29694 , \"longitude\" : 2.07833 }, \"address\" : { \"cityName\" : \"BARCELONA\" , \"cityCode\" : \"BCN\" , \"countryName\" : \"SPAIN\" , \"countryCode\" : \"ES\" , \"regionCode\" : \"EUROP\" }, \"distance\" : { \"value\" : 496 , \"unit\" : \"KM\" }, \"analytics\" : { \"flights\" : { \"score\" : 25 }, \"travelers\" : { \"score\" : 25 } }, \"relevance\" : 5.11921 } What we want to do at this point, is to find the cheapest dates for all these destinations. We can do this by calling the Flight Cheapest Date Search API which finds the cheapest dates to travel from one city to another. Let's see, for example, the cheapest dates to fly to Barcelona in November 2021. GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-dates?origin=MAD&destination=BCN&departureDate=2021-05-01,2021-05-30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 { \"type\" : \"flight-date\" , \"origin\" : \"MAD\" , \"destination\" : \"BCN\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2021-05-29\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2021-06-11\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"73.61\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDestinations\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin=MAD&departureDate=2021-05-01,2021-05-30&oneWay=false&duration=1,15&nonStop=false&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=MAD&destinationLocationCode=BCN&departureDate=2022-09-29&returnDate=2021-06-11&adults=1&nonStop=false\" }, { \"type\" : \"flight-date\" , \"origin\" : \"MAD\" , \"destination\" : \"BCN\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2021-05-05\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2021-05-06\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"79.67\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDestinations\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin=MAD&departureDate=2021-05-01,2021-05-30&oneWay=false&duration=1,15&nonStop=false&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=MAD&destinationLocationCode=BCN&departureDate=2021-05-05&returnDate=2021-05-06&adults=1&nonStop=false\" } }, { \"type\" : \"flight-date\" , \"origin\" : \"MAD\" , \"destination\" : \"BCN\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2021-05-02\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2021-05-06\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"80.61\" }, \"links\" : { \"flightDestinations\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin=MAD&departureDate=2021-05-01,2021-05-30&oneWay=false&duration=1,15&nonStop=false&viewBy=DURATION\" , \"flightOffers\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=MAD&destinationLocationCode=BCN&departureDate=2021-05-02&returnDate=2021-05-06&adults=1&nonStop=false\" } } As you can see above, in the results we have a list of dates for a roundtrip from Madrid to Barcelona ordered by the lowest price. In the last step, we want to let the traveler perform a flight search for any of the above dates that are convenient for them. That is very easy with our APIs, as the Flight Cheapest Date Search API for each result contains a link to the Flight Offers Search API . For example, if we want to perform a flight search for the first result, we only have to take the link provided and make an API call: GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/flight-offers?originLocationCode=MAD&destinationLocationCode=BCN&departureDate=2021-05-29&returnDate=2021-06-11&adults=1&nonStop=false Search for a city that has an airport The Airport & City Search API finds airports and cities that match a specific word or a string of letters. Using this API, you can automatically suggest airports based on what the traveler enters in the search field. The API provides a list of airports/cities ordered by yearly passenger volume with the name, 3-letter IATA code, time zone and coordinates of each airport. The main difference between the Airport & City Search API and City Search API is that the Airport & City Search API only shows cities that have an airport, while the City Search API retrieves any city that matches a search keyword. You can see the process step to step in this video tutorial. Compare the flight price to histrocal fares When booking a flight, travelers need to be confident that they're getting a good deal. You can compare a flight price to historical fares for the same flight route using the Flight Price Analysis API . It uses an Artificial Intelligence algorithm trained on Amadeus historical flight booking data to show how current flight prices compare to historical fares and whether the price of a flight is below or above average. Let's see how it works. In our example we will be flying from Madrid (MAD) to Paris (CDG) on 12 December 2022. We will check prices in Euros for a one way ticket. 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/analytics/itinerary-price-metrics?originIataCode = MAD & destinationIataCode = CDG & departureDate = 2021 -03-21 & currencyCode = EUR & oneWay = true This is what we get in the response: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 { \"warnings\" : [ { \"code\" : 22443 , \"title\" : \"WARNING\" , \"detail\" : \"Unsupported currency code.

The first, medium and trird choices give you an idea about the possible price ranges for this flight. Confirm Fares The availability and price of airfare fluctuate, so it\u2019s important to confirm before proceeding to book. This is especially true if time passes between the initial search and the decision to book, as fares are limited and there are thousands of bookings occurring every minute. During this step, you can also add ancillary products like extra bags or legroom. For that you can use the Flight Offers Price API . Once a flight has been selected, you\u2019ll need to confirm the availability and price of the fare. This is where the Flight Offers Price API comes in. This API returns the final fare price (including taxes and fees) of flights from the Flight Offers Search as well as pricing for ancillary products and the payment information that will be needed to make the final booking. The body to be sent via POST is built by a new object of type flight-offers-pricing composed by a list of flight-offers (up to 6) + payment information. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 { \"data\" : { \"type\" : \"flight-offers-princing\" , \"flightOffers\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" } ], \"payment\" : [ { Payme nt _Objec t } ] } Return fare rules The Flight Offers Price API confirms the final price and availability of a fare. It also returns detailed fare rules, including the cancellation policy and other information. To get the fare rules, add the parameter include=detailed-fare-rules to your API call, as shown below: 1 POST https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-offers/pricing?include = detailed-fare-rules Book a Flight Once the fare is confirmed, you\u2019re ready to use the Flight Create Orders API to perform the actual booking. This API lets you log a reservation in the airlines\u2019 systems and create a PNR , and returns a unique Id number and the reservation details. If you\u2019re using an airline consolidator, the PNR will be automatically sent to the consolidator for ticket issuance. Visit the Flight Create Orders documentation page for more details on this API. Remember, you need to be able to issue a ticket to make bookings with our Flight Create Orders API . To access the API in production, you need to either sign a contract with an airline consolidator or be accredited to issue tickets yourself. You can see the process step to step in this video tutorial. Issue a ticket Once the booking is made, you need to complete payment. In most cases, you\u2019ll receive payment from the customer and then pay the airline, typically via an industry-specific settlement procedure like the BSP or ARC (more on those later). In the final step, a flight ticket is issued. In industry terms, a flight ticket is a confirmation that payment has been received, the reservation has been logged, and the customer has the right to enjoy the flight. For IATA member airlines , only certain accredited parties can issue tickets. In the next section, we\u2019ll go into detail about your options for managing this final step in the booking process. If you are interested in knowing more about issuing tickets in travel industry, please check out this article . View the aircraft cabin layout With the Seatmap Display API you can view the aircraft cabin layout: deckConfiguration - the dimensions of the passenger deck in (x,y) coordinates, including the location of the wings, exit rows, and cabins. These dimensions form a grid on which you will later place facilities and seats. facilities - the (x,y) coordinates of aircraft facilities, such as bathrooms or galleys. seats - the (x,y) coordinates of all seats on the aircraft, with their respective availability status, characteristics, and prices. To help you build a more consistent display, the API returns a uniform width for all cabins and classes. Rows with special seating like business class or extra-legroom seats have fewer seats per row (e.g., 4 seats for width of 7 coordinates) than economy rows (e.g. 7 seats for a width of 7 coordinates). You can see the more details about the aircraft cabin layout in the video below. Display in-flight amenities Both endpoints of the Seatmap Display API return information about the following in-flight amenities: Seat Wi-fi Entertainment Power Food Beverage Select a seat Requests to either endpoint of the Seatmap Display API will return a list of seating options with their characteristics, pricing, and coordinates. Let's look at an example response: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 { \"cabin\" : \"M\" , \"number\" : \"20D\" , \"characteristicsCodes\" : [ \"A\" , \"CH\" , \"RS\" ], \"travelerPricing\" : [ { \"travelerId\" : \"1\" , \"seatAvailabilityStatus\" : \"AVAILABLE\" , \"price\" : { \"currency\" : \"EUR\" , \"total\" : \"17.00\" , \"base\" : \"17.00\" , \"taxes\" : [ { \"amount\" : \"0.00\" , \"code\" : \"SUPPLIER\" } ] } } ], \"coordinates\" : { \"x\" : 10 , \"y\" : 4 } }, For each seat, the Seatmap Display API provides a seatAvailabilityStatus so you can indicate which seats are currently available for booking. Seats may have one of three\u202favailability statuses: AVAILABLE \u202f\u2013 the seat is\u202fnot occupied\u202fand\u202fis\u202favailable to book. BLOCKED \u202f\u2013\u202fthe seat is not occupied but isn\u2019t\u202favailable to book for the user. This is usually due to the passenger type (e.g., children may not sit in exit rows) or their fare class (e.g., some seats may be reserved for flyers in higher classes). OCCUPIED \u202f\u2013 the seat is\u202f occupied\u202fand\u202funavailable to book. If a flight is fully booked, the API returns an OCCUPIED status for all seats. In most cases, fully booked flights are filtered\u202fout during search with\u202fthe Flight Offers Search API \u202for when confirming the price with\u202fthe Flight Offers Price API .\u202fThe Flight Create Orders API returns an error message if you try to book an unavailable seat. For more information on the booking flow, check out how to build a flight booking engine. Once your user has selected their seat, the next step is to add the desired seat to the flight offer and prepare them for booking. In the above\u202fexample\u202fresponse,\u202fseat\u202f 20D is indicated as AVAILABLE . For your user to be able to book the seat, you must\u202fadd the seat to the flightOffer object and call Flight Offers Price \u202fto\u202fget a final order summary with the included seat. To include the seat in the flightOffer object, add it to\u202f fareDetailsBySegment \u2192 additionalServices \u2192 chargeableSeatNumber , as shown below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 \"fareDetailsBySegment\" : [ { \"additionalServices\" : { \"chargeableSeatNumber\" : \"20D\" }, \"segmentId\" : \"60\" , \"cabin\" : \"ECONOMY\" , \"fareBasis\" : \"NLYO5L\" , \"brandedFare\" : \"LITE\" , \"class\" : \"N\" , \"includedCheckedBags\" : { \"quantity\" : 0 } } ] The Flight Offers Price API then returns the flightOffer object with the price of the chosen seat included within additionalServices : 1 2 3 4 5 \"additionalServices\" : { \"type\" : \"SEATS\" , \"amount\" : \"17.00\" } You can use the same process to select seats for multiple passengers.\u202fFor each passenger, you must add the selected seats\u202fin\u202f fareDetailsBySegment \u202ffor each travelerId within the\u202fflight offer. At this point, you now have a priced flightOffer which includes your user's selected seat. The final step is to book the flight using the Flight Create Orders API . To do this, simply pass the flightOffer object into\u202fa request to the Flight Create Orders API , which will book the flight and return an order summary and a booking Id. Add additional baggage Search additional baggage options The first step is to find the desired flight offer using the Flight Offers Search API . Each flight offer contains an additionalServices field with the types of additional services available, in this case bags, and the maximum price of the first additional bag. Note that at this point, the price is for informational purposes only. To get the final price of the added baggage with the airline policy and the traveler's tier level taken into account, you must call the Flight Offers Price API . To do this, add the include=bags parameter in the path of the Flight Offers Price API : 1 POST https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-offers/pricing?include = bags As you see below, the API returns the catalog of baggage options with the price and quantity (or weight): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 \"bags\" : { \"1\" : { \"quantity\" : 1 , \"name\" : \"CHECKED_BAG\" , \"price\" : { \"amount\" : \"25.00\" , \"currencyCode\" : \"EUR\" }, \"bookableByItinerary\" : true , \"segmentIds\" : [ \"1\" , \"14\" ], \"travelerIds\" : [ \"1\" ] } \"2\" : { \"quantity\" : 2 , \"name\" : \"CHECKED_BAG\" , \"price\" : { \"amount\" : \"50.00\" , \"currencyCode\" : \"EUR\" }, \"bookableByItinerary\" : true , \"segmentIds\" : [ \"1\" , \"14\" ], \"travelerIds\" : [ \"1\" ] } } The Flight Offers Price API returns two bag offers for the given flight. The catalog shows that either one or two bags are available to be booked per passenger. Higher bag quantity will be rejected due to the airline's policy. In the example above, the price of two bags is double that of one bag, though some airlines do offer discounts for purchasing more than one checked bag. Each bag offer is coupled to the specific segment and traveler Id returned in each bag offer. If there is no extra baggage service available, the API won\u2019t return a baggage catalog. Add additional baggage to the flight offer Next, you need to add the additional baggage to the desired flight segments. This gives you the flexibility to include extra bags on only certain segments of the flight. Fill in chargeableCheckedBags with the desired quantity (or weight, depending on what the airline returns) in travelerPricings/fareDetailsBySegment/additionalServices , as shown below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 \"fareDetailsBySegment\" : [{ \"segmentId\" : \"1\" , \"cabin\" : \"ECONOMY\" , \"fareBasis\" : \"TNOBAGD\" , \"brandedFare\" : \"GOLIGHT\" , \"class\" : \"T\" , \"includedCheckedBags\" : { \"quantity\" : 0 }, \"additionalServices\" : { \"chargeableCheckedBags\" : { \"quantity\" : 1 } } }] Confirm the final price and book Once you\u2019ve added the desired bags to the flight order, you need to call the Flight Offers Price API to get the final price of the flight with all additional services included. Once this is done, you can then call the Flight Create Orders API to book the flight. If you want to add different numbers of bags for different itineraries, you can do it following the same flow. If the desired flight you want to book, does not permit the additional service, the Flight Create Orders API will reject the booking and return the following error: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 { \"errors\" : [{ \"status\" : 400 , \"code\" : 38034 , \"title\" : \"ONE OR MORE SERVICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE\" , \"detail\" : \"Error booking additional services\" }] } You can see the process step to step in this video tutorial. Check the flight status The On-Demand Flight Status API provides real-time flight schedule data including up-to-date departure and arrival times, terminal and gate information, flight duration and real-time delay status. To get this information, just send a query with the IATA carrier code, flight number and scheduled departure date, and you'll be up to date about your flight schedule. Check for any flight delays For any traveller it's quite important to know how far in advance they should get to the airport. The Flight Delay Prediction API estimates the probability of a specific flight being delayed. Check the on-time performance of an airport Another way to get prepared for any delays, is checking the on-time performance of the actual airport. The Flight Delay Prediction API estimates the probability of a specific flight being delayed. The search query is very simple. In our query we only need to provide our flight departure date and the departure airport. For example, JFK on 12 December 2022. 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/airport/predictions/on-time?airportCode = JFK & date = 2022 -12-12 This is the result: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 { \"data\" : { \"id\" : \"JFK20221212\" , \"probability\" : \"0.928\" , \"result\" : \"0.77541769\" , \"subType\" : \"on-time\" , \"type\" : \"prediction\" }, \"meta\" : { \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/airport/predictions/on-time?airportCode=JFK&date=2022-12-12\" } } } The probability parameter shows the probability of the airport running smoothly. In our example, this metric means that there is a 92.8% chance that there will be no delays. Get a direct link to the airline check-in page Suppose we are building an app with an integrated check-in flow for a particular airline. In this case, we can leverage the Flight Check-in Links API to generate a link to the airline's official check-in page in a required language for both web and mobile platforms. The only parameter that we need to provide in our search query is the airline's IATA code. If required, we can request the links in a specific language, such as UK English (en-GB). This is what our request would look like: 1 2 3 curl --request GET \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\ --url https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/reference-data/urls/checkin-links?airlineCode = BA & language = en-GB \\ This is what we get in the response: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 { \"meta\" : { \"count\" : 3 , \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/reference-data/urls/checkin-links?airlineCode=BA&language=EN-GB\" } }, \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"checkin-link\" , \"id\" : \"BAEN-GBAll\" , \"href\" : \"https://www.britishairways.com/travel/olcilandingpageauthreq/public/en_gb\" , \"channel\" : \"All\" }, { \"type\" : \"checkin-link\" , \"id\" : \"BAEN-GBMobile\" , \"href\" : \"https://www.britishairways.com/travel/olcilandingpageauthreq/public/en_gb/device-mobile\" , \"channel\" : \"Mobile\" }, { \"type\" : \"checkin-link\" , \"id\" : \"BAEN-GBWeb\" , \"href\" : \"https://www.britishairways.com/travel/olcilandingpageauthreq/public/en_gb\" , \"channel\" : \"Web\" } ] } Here we've got a dedicated link for web applications, a dedicated link for mobile applications and a link that works on all platforms. Cancel a reservation Just as you can help users book a flight with the Flight Create Orders API , you can now also help them cancel their reservations with the Flight Order Management API. However, you have a limited window of time to cancel via API. If you\u2019re working with an airline consolidator for ticketing, cancellations via API are generally only allowed while the order is queued for ticketing. Once the ticket has been issued, you\u2019ll have to contact your consolidator directly to handle the cancellation. To call the Flight Order Management API , you have pass as a parameter the flight-orderId from the Flight Create Orders API, such as: 1 DELETE https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/booking/flight-orders/eJzTd9f3NjIJdzUGAAp%2fAiY View reservation details With the Flight Order Management API you can consult and check your flight reservation. To call the Flight Order Management API , you have pass as a parameter the flight-orderId from the Flight Create Orders API , such as: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/booking/flight-orders/eJzTd9f3NjIJdzUGAAp%2fAiY Common Errors Issuance not allowed in Self Service Self-Service users must work with an airline consolidator that can issue tickets on your behalf. In that case, the payment is not processed by the API but directly between you and the consolidator. Adding a form of payment to the Flight Create Orders API will be rejected by error INVALID FORMAT. Price discrepancy The price of airfare fluctuates constantly. Creating an order for a flight whose price is no longer valid at the time of booking will trigger the following error: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 { \"errors\" : [ { \"status\" : 400 , \"code\" : 37200 , \"title\" : \"PRICE DISCREPANCY\" , \"detail\" : \"Current grandTotal price (2780.28) is different from request one (2779.58)\" } ] } If you receive this error, reconfirm the fare price with the Flight Offers Price API before booking. The following is a common error in the test environment, as you can perform many bookings without restrictions (no real payment), but the inventory is a copy of the real one, so if you book many seats, the inventory will be empty and you won't be able to book anymore. 1 2 3 4 5 6 { \"status\" : 400 , \"code\" : 34651 , \"title\" : \"SEGMENT SELL FAILURE\" , \"detail\" : \"Could not sell segment 1\" } Notes Carriers and rates Low cost carriers (LCCs), American Airlines are not available. Depending on the market, British Airways is also not available. Published rates only returned in Self-Service. Cannot access to negotiated rates, or any other special rates. Post-booking modifications With the current version of our Self-Service APIs, you can\u2019t add additional baggage after the flight has been booked. This and other post-booking modifications must be handled directly with the airline consolidator that is issuing tickets on your behalf. How payment works There are two things to consider regarding payments for flight booking: The payment between you (the app owner) and your customers (for the services provided + the price of the flight ticket). You decide how to collect this payment, it is not included in the API. A third party payment gateway, such as Stripe will be an easier solution for this. The payment between you and the consolidator (to be able to pay the airline and issue the flight ticket). This will be done between you and your consolidator of choice, and is to be agreed with the consolidator.","title":"Flights"},{"location":"resources/flights/#flights","text":"The Flights category contains a wide array of APIs that can help you manage flights, from searching for flight options to actually booking a flight. Information Our catalogue of Self-Service APIs is currently organised by categories that are different to what you see on this page.

You can see the process step to step in this video tutorial.","title":"Book a Flight"},{"location":"resources/flights/#issue-a-ticket","text":"Once the booking is made, you need to complete payment. In most cases, you\u2019ll receive payment from the customer and then pay the airline, typically via an industry-specific settlement procedure like the BSP or ARC (more on those later). In the final step, a flight ticket is issued. In industry terms, a flight ticket is a confirmation that payment has been received, the reservation has been logged, and the customer has the right to enjoy the flight. For IATA member airlines , only certain accredited parties can issue tickets. In the next section, we\u2019ll go into detail about your options for managing this final step in the booking process.

To help you build a more consistent display, the API returns a uniform width for all cabins and classes. Rows with special seating like business class or extra-legroom seats have fewer seats per row (e.g., 4 seats for width of 7 coordinates) than economy rows (e.g. 7 seats for a width of 7 coordinates).

Hotel Name Autocomplete API Provides a list of up to 20 hotels whose names most closely match the search query string. Let's learn how to get started and help your users book the perfect rooms at over 150,000 hotels worldwide. Information This page has been updated based on Hotel Search V3 updates since MAY 2022. Search hotels Get a list of hotels by location First, users should be able to search hotels for a given location. The Hotel List API returns the list of hotels based on a city or a geographic code. To answer a question, such as \"what are the hotels closed to the city hall?\" the Hotel List API has three endpoints to utilize based on your search criteria. It returns hotel name , location , and hotel id for you to proceed to the next steps of the hotel search. Based on the search criteria, you will get the list of hotelId with hotel information as in the example below. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 { \"chainCode\" : \"AC\" , \"iataCode\" : \"PAR\" , \"dupeId\" : 700169556 , \"name\" : \"ACROPOLIS HOTEL PARIS BOULOGNE\" , \"hotelId\" : \"ACPARH29\" , \"geoCode\" : { \"latitude\" : 48.83593 , \"longitude\" : 2.24922 }, \"address\" : { \"countryCode\" : \"FR\" }, \"lastUpdate\" : \"2022-03-01T15:22:17\" } Search hotels by a city or Geocode You can specify an IATA city code or Geocode to search a more specific area to get the list of hotels. You can customize the request using parameters, such as radius, chain code, amenities, star ratings, and hotel source. For example: Using the by-city endpoint, get a list of hotels in Paris with a swimming pool and more than four stars: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-city?cityCode = PAR & amenities = SWIMMING_POOL & ratings = 4 ,5 Using the by-geocode endpoint, get a list of hotels in Paris (latitude=41.397158 and longitude=2.160873): 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-geocode?latitude = 41 .397158 & longitude = 2 .160873 Search hotels by hotel ids If you already know the Id of a hotel that you would like to check, you can use it to call the Hotel List API . 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-hotels?hotelIds = ACPARF58 Autocomplete Hotel Names Your application can also display a list of suggested hotel names based on keywords used in the search query. Hotel Name Autocomplete API provides a list of up to 20 hotels whose names most closely match the search query string. For each hotel in the results, the API also provides descriptive data, including the hotel name, address, geocode, property type, IATA hotel code and the Amadeus hotel ID.

Hotel Ratings API returns ratings for many crucial elements of a hotel, such as sleep quality, services, facilities, room comfort, value for money, location and many others. Hotel Ratings API guarantees high-quality service for your customers. The sentiment analysis, just like the one below, is displayed in a simple flow to allow you to easily identify the best hotels based on traveler reviews: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/e-reputation/hotel-sentiments?hotelIds = TELONMFS,ADNYCCTB,XXXYYY01 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"hotelSentiment\" , \"numberOfReviews\" : 218 , \"numberOfRatings\" : 278 , \"hotelId\" : \"ADNYCCTB\" , \"overallRating\" : 93 , \"sentiments\" : { \"sleepQuality\" : 87 , \"service\" : 98 , \"facilities\" : 90 , \"roomComforts\" : 92 , \"valueForMoney\" : 87 , \"catering\" : 89 , \"location\" : 98 , \"pointsOfInterest\" : 91 , \"staff\" : 100 } }, { \"type\" : \"hotelSentiment\" , \"numberOfReviews\" : 2667 , \"numberOfRatings\" : 2666 , \"hotelId\" : \"TELONMFS\" , \"overallRating\" : 81 , \"sentiments\" : { \"sleepQuality\" : 78 , \"service\" : 80 , \"facilities\" : 75 , \"roomComforts\" : 87 , \"valueForMoney\" : 75 , \"catering\" : 81 , \"location\" : 89 , \"internet\" : 72 , \"pointsOfInterest\" : 81 , \"staff\" : 89 } } ] With these additional filters, your booking process becomes more efficient and you can offer your customers an enriched shopping experience. In this way, you can be confident that you are offering a highly rated hotels selection in the areas that customers appreciate the most. Check Availabilities and Prices Once users have explored the list of hotels in their desired area, they would want to check the price of a specific hotel or compare the prices of hotels on the list. With the hotelIds that you got from Hotel List API , you now can check the available rooms with real-time prices and room descriptions by calling the Hotel Search API . An example to request available rooms and prices for one room in Hilton Paris Opera for one adult with check-in date 2022-11-22: 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v3/shopping/hotel-offers?hotelIds = HLPAR266 & adults = 1 & checkInDate = 2022 -11-22 & roomQuantity = 1 The API returns a list of offers objects containing the price of the cheapest available room as well as information including the room description and payment policy.

You\u2019ve just performed your first hotel booking! Once the reservation is made, the API will return a unique booking confirmation ID which you can send to your users. Notes about Payment The Hotel Search API returns information about the payment policy of each hotel. The main policy types are: Guarantee : the hotel will save credit card information during booking but not make any charges to the account. In the case of a no-show or out-of-policy cancellation, the hotel may charge penalties to the card. Deposit : at the time of booking or by a given deadline, the hotel will charge the guest a percentage of the total amount of the reservation. The remaining amount is paid by the traveler directly at the hotel. Prepay : the total amount of the reservation fee must be paid by the traveler when making the booking. The current version of the Hotel Booking API only permits booking at hotels that accept credit cards. During the booking process, Amadeus passes the payment and guest information to the hotel but does not validate this information. Be sure to validate the payment and guest information, as invalid information may result in the reservation being canceled. As soon as your application stores transmits, or processes cardholder information, you will need to comply with\u202fPCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). For more information, visit the PCI Security Council website . Guide for multiple hotel rooms Now that we have gone through the hotel booking flow, you may wonder how to proceed to booking more than two rooms in a hotel. Check availability and prices for multiple rooms The first step to booking multiple rooms is to search for hotels in your destination with the desired number of available rooms. You can do this by specifying the roomQuantity parameter when you call the Hotel Search API using the hotelid that you got from the Hotel List API . Here is an example of a search in Hilton Paris for two rooms for three adults : 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v3/shopping/hotel-offers?hotelIds = HLPAR266 & adults = 3 & checkInDate = 2022 -11-22 & roomQuantity = 2 The API will then return the available offers where roomQuantity is equal to 2. 1 2 3 4 5 6 \"offers\" : [ { \"id\" : \"48E6C8C7DAA0BA5C22663E2A2A2B7629F5468BCBE2722FE4AB8174\" , \"roomQuantity\" : \"2\" , \"checkInDate\" : \"2022-11-22\" , \"checkOutDate\" : \"2022-11-23\" , Book multiple rooms with details for one guest To call the Hotel Booking API , you must provide details for at least one guest per offer (the offer contains all rooms for the reservation). For example, the JSON query below provides details of one guest to book two rooms by offerId : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 { \"data\" :{ \"offerId\" : \"F837D841218665647003CC9A8CA2A37CEC7276BBE14F9B9C525FBD1B7B69A8FF\" , \"guests\" :[ { \"name\" :{ \"title\" : \"MR\" , \"firstName\" : \"BOB\" , \"lastName\" : \"SMITH\" }, \"contact\" :{ \"phone\" : \"+33679278416\" , \"email\" : \"bob.smith@email.com\" } } ], \"payments\" :[ { \"method\" : \"creditCard\" , \"card\" :{ \"vendorCode\" : \"VI\" , \"cardNumber\" : \"4111111111111111\" , \"expiryDate\" : \"2026-01\" } } ] } } Once the booking is complete, the API will return the following confirmation: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"hotel-booking\" , \"id\" : \"HA_36000507\" , \"providerConfirmationId\" : \"36000507\" , \"associatedRecords\" : [ { \"reference\" : \"R622XL\" , \"originSystemCode\" : \"GDS\" } ] }, { \"type\" : \"hotel-booking\" , \"id\" : \"HA_36000506\" , \"providerConfirmationId\" : \"36000506\" , \"associatedRecords\" : [ { \"reference\" : \"R622XL\" , \"originSystemCode\" : \"GDS\" } ] } ] } Book multiple rooms with guest distribution One common question is how to assign guest distribution among the booked rooms. When you call the Hotel Booking API , the rooms object represents the rooms. Each room contains guests distributed per room. Specifically, each room object needs IDs of the guests staying in that room. Below is a sample request to book two rooms with guest distribution. The first room is for guest ID\u2019s 1 & 2 and the second room for guest Id 3 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 { \"data\" : { \"offerId\" : \"4A449AE835DD68F2E7C3571740FD00B76209D7311E719E3B66DE4E1100\" , \"guests\" : [ { \"id\" : 1 , \"name\" : { \"title\" : \"MR\" , \"firstName\" : \"BOB\" , \"lastName\" : \"SMITH\" }, \"contact\" : { \"phone\" : \"+33679278416\" , \"email\" : \"bob.smith@email.com\" } }, { \"id\" : 2 , \"name\" : { \"title\" : \"MRS\" , \"firstName\" : \"EMILY\" , \"lastName\" : \"SMITH\" }, \"contact\" : { \"phone\" : \"+33679278416\" , \"email\" : \"bob.smith@email.com\" } }, { \"id\" : 3 , \"name\" : { \"firstName\" : \"JOHNY\" , \"lastName\" : \"SMITH\" }, \"contact\" : { \"phone\" : \"+33679278416\" , \"email\" : \"bob.smith@email.com\" } } ], \"payments\" : [ { \"id\" : 1 , \"method\" : \"creditCard\" , \"card\" : { \"vendorCode\" : \"VI\" , \"cardNumber\" : \"4151289722471370\" , \"expiryDate\" : \"2026-08\" } } ], \"rooms\" : [ { \"guestIds\" : [ 1 , 2 ], \"paymentId\" : 1 , \"specialRequest\" : \"I will arrive at midnight\" }, { \"guestIds\" : [ 3 ], \"paymentId\" : 1 , \"specialRequest\" : \"I will arrive at midnight\" } ] } } The API response will be the same as when you booked multiple rooms using the details of just one guest: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"hotel-booking\" , \"id\" : \"XK_88803316\" , \"providerConfirmationId\" : \"88803316\" , \"associatedRecords\" : [ { \"reference\" : \"MJ6HLK\" , \"originSystemCode\" : \"GDS\" } ] }, { \"type\" : \"hotel-booking\" , \"id\" : \"XK_88803315\" , \"providerConfirmationId\" : \"88803315\" , \"associatedRecords\" : [ { \"reference\" : \"MJ6HLK\" , \"originSystemCode\" : \"GDS\" } ] } ] \u200b Common Errors AcceptedPayments must be creditCards The current version of the Hotel Booking API only supports credit card payments, which are accepted by most hotels. The Hotel Search API returns the payment policy of each hotel under acceptedPayments in the policies section. Empty response from the View Room endpoint If you get an empty response from the Hotel Search API\u2019s second endpoint, then the hotel is fully booked and has no vacancy for the requested dates. If you don't use the checkInDate and checkOutDate parameters in the request, the API will return results for a one-night stay starting on the current date. If the hotel is full, the response will be empty.

The main policy types are: Guarantee : the hotel will save credit card information during booking but not make any charges to the account. In the case of a no-show or out-of-policy cancellation, the hotel may charge penalties to the card. Deposit : at the time of booking or by a given deadline, the hotel will charge the guest a percentage of the total amount of the reservation. The remaining amount is paid by the traveler directly at the hotel. Prepay : the total amount of the reservation fee must be paid by the traveler when making the booking. The current version of the Hotel Booking API only permits booking at hotels that accept credit cards. During the booking process, Amadeus passes the payment and guest information to the hotel but does not validate this information. Be sure to validate the payment and guest information, as invalid information may result in the reservation being canceled.

Information Our catalogue of Self-Service APIs is currently organised by categories that are different to what you see on this page. APIs Description Trip Parser Build a single itinerary with information from different booking confirmation emails. Trip Purpose Prediction Analyze a flight itinerary and predict whether the trip is for business or leisure. City Search Finds cities that match a specific word or string of letters. Parse the email confirmation into JSON The Trip Parser API helps to extract information from different booking confirmation emails and compile it into a single structured JSON itinerary. This API can parse information from flight , hotel , rail , and rental car confirmation emails. It provides the result of your parsing immediately, thanks to our algorithm. Encode your booking confirmation in Base64 The first step to parsing is to encode your booking confirmation file in Base64 format. This will give you the base of your API request. You should not add formatting or any other elements to your booking confirmation as it will affect the parsing. There are many tools and software that you can use for Base64 encoding. Some programming languages implement encoding and decoding functionalities in their standard library. In python , for example, it will look similar to this: 1 2 3 4 import base64 with open ( \"booking.pdf\" , \"rb\" ) as booking_file : encoded_string = base64 . b64encode ( booking_file . read ()) print ( encoded_string ) Get the parsing results Next, add the encoded booking confirmation to the body of a POST request to the endpoint 1 POST https://test.api.amadeus.com/v3/travel/trip-parser 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 { \"payload\" : \"your Base64 code here\" , \"metadata\" : { \"documentType\" : \"PDF\" , \"name\" : \"BOOKING_DOCUMENT\" , \"encoding\" : \"BASE_64\" } } documentType : pdf, xml, json or jpg encoding : BASE_64 or BASE_64_URL This will extract all the relevant data from the booking information into a structured JSON format, just like the example below. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 { \"data\" : { \"trip\" : { \"reference\" : \"JUPDRM\" , \"stakeholders\" : [ { \"name\" : { \"firstName\" : \"MIGUEL\" , \"lastName\" : \"TORRES\" } } ], \"products\" : [ { \"air\" : { \"departure\" : { \"localDateTime\" : \"2021-06-16T08:36:00\" }, \"arrival\" : { \"localDateTime\" : \"2021-06-17T00:00:00\" }, \"marketing\" : { \"flightDesignator\" : { \"carrierCode\" : \"CM\" , \"flightNumber\" : \"644\" } } } }, { \"air\" : { \"departure\" : { \"localDateTime\" : \"2021-06-16T11:21:00\" }, \"arrival\" : { \"localDateTime\" : \"2021-06-17T00:00:00\" }, \"marketing\" : { \"flightDesignator\" : { \"carrierCode\" : \"CM\" , \"flightNumber\" : \"426\" } } } }, { \"air\" : { \"departure\" : { \"localDateTime\" : \"2021-06-20T18:56:00\" }, \"arrival\" : { \"localDateTime\" : \"2021-06-21T00:00:00\" }, \"marketing\" : { \"flightDesignator\" : { \"carrierCode\" : \"CM\" , \"flightNumber\" : \"645\" } } } } ] } } } Predict the trip purpose from a flight Another API in the itinerary management category, the Trip Purpose Prediction API , predicts whether a flight is searched for business or leisure . Our machine-learning models have detected which patterns of departure and arrival cities, flight dates, and search dates are associated with business and leisure trips. Understand why your users travel and show them the flights, fares, and ancillaries that suit them best. Below is an example to see if the flight from New York to Madrid from 2022-12-01 to 2022-12-12 is leisure or business. 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/travel/predictions/trip-purpose?originLocationCode = NYC & destinationLocationCode = MAD & departureDate = 2022 -12-01 & returnDate = 2022 -12-12 The result?

This API uses a keyword, which is a string containing a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 10 characters, to search for a city whose name contains this keyword. It is not critical whether you enter the entire city name or only a part of it. For example, Paris , Par or ari will all return Paris in the search results. There are two optional parameters to help you make the query more precise - countryCode and max . The countryCode is a string for the ISO 3166 Alpha-2 code of the country where you need to locate a city, for example, FR for France. The max is an integer that defines the maximum number of search results. You can also include a list of airports for each city returned in the search results. To do this, you need to add AIRPORTS to the include field, which is an array of strings defining additional resources for your search. Let's check out the results for keyword PAR . We will limit the search scope to FR and the number of results to two. 1 GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/cities?countryCode = FR & keyword = PAR & max = 2 The results are probably rather predictable: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 { \"meta\" : { \"count\" : 2 , \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/cities?countryCode=FR&keyword=PAR&max=2\" } }, \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subType\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"Paris\" , \"iataCode\" : \"PAR\" , \"address\" : { \"countryCode\" : \"FR\" , \"stateCode\" : \"FR-75\" }, \"geoCode\" : { \"latitude\" : 48.85341 , \"longitude\" : 2.3488 } }, { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subType\" : \"city\" , \"name\" : \"Le Touquet-Paris-Plage\" , \"iataCode\" : \"LTQ\" , \"address\" : { \"countryCode\" : \"FR\" , \"stateCode\" : \"FR-62\" }, \"geoCode\" : { \"latitude\" : 50.52432 , \"longitude\" : 1.58571 } } ] } First of all we see the French capital at the top of the list.

For a given latitude and longitude, it provides popularity scores for the following leisure and tourism categories: Sightseeing Restaurants Shopping Nightlife For each category, the API provides an overall popularity score as well as scores for select subcategories, such as luxury shopping, vegetarian restaurants, or historical sights. Location scores are on a simple 0-100 scale and are powered by the AVUXI TopPlace algorithm, which analyzes millions of online reviews, comments, and points of interest. Notes For each location, the API will return scores for a 200m., 500m., and 1500m. radius. Scores indicate positive traveler sentiments and may not reflect the most visited locations.

You can refer to the amadeus-node or Amadeus npm package for more details on the changelog. Installation This module has been tested using Node LTS versions . You can install it using Yarn or NPM. 1 npm install amadeus --save Getting Started To make your first API call, you will need to register for an Amadeus Developers Account and set up your first application . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 var Amadeus = require ( 'amadeus' ); var amadeus = new Amadeus ({ clientId : 'REPLACE_BY_YOUR_API_KEY' , clientSecret : 'REPLACE_BY_YOUR_API_SECRET' }); amadeus . shopping . flightOffersSearch . get ({ originLocationCode : 'SYD' , destinationLocationCode : 'BKK' , departureDate : '2022-10-21' , adults : '2' }). then ( function ( response ){ console . log ( response . data ); }). catch ( function ( responseError ){ console . log ( responseError . code ); }); Initialization The client can be initialized directly as below. Your credentials client Id and Client Secret can be found on the Amadeus dashboard . 1 2 3 4 5 // Initialize using parameters var amadeus = new Amadeus ({ clientId : 'REPLACE_BY_YOUR_API_KEY' , clientSecret : 'REPLACE_BY_YOUR_API_SECRET' }); Warning Remember that hardcoding your credentials is not the best practice due to the potential exposure to others. Read more about best practices for secure API key storage . Alternatively, you can initialize by setting up environment variables. In Node, we like to use dotenv package . 1 npm install dotenv Put your API credentials in .env file: 1 2 AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID = REPLACE_BY_YOUR_API_KEY, AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET = REPLACE_BY_YOUR_API_SECRET Initialize using dotenv package: 1 2 const dotenv = require ( 'dotenv' ). config (); var amadeus = new Amadeus (); Important You will also want to add .env to your .gitingore so that your API credentials aren't included in your git repository. If you don't want to use another package, you can also simply export your key in terminal directly to initalize. Export your credentials in terminal: 1 2 export AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID = \"REPLACE_BY_YOUR_API_KEY\" export AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET = \"REPLACE_BY_YOUR_API_SECRET\" Initialize: 1 var amadeus = new Amadeus (); Moving to Production By default, the SDK environment is set to test environment. To switch to production (pay-as-you-go) environment, please change the hostname as follows: 1 2 3 var amadeus = new Amadeus ({ hostname : 'production' }); Promises Every API call returns a Promise that either resolves or rejects.

At Amadeus, we are following the contract-first approach to API development, which is at the core of the OpenAPI Generator's design philosophy. In this way, we only need to create or update an OpenAPI specification for a particluar API, and the OpenAPI Generator will automatically generate the SDKs in various programming languages and create the required API documentation. Amadeus OpenAPI specification We have a dedicated GitHub repository where you can find OpenAPI specification files for all our Self-Serving APIs. The OpenAPI Generator can easily consume these files to output a dedicated SDK for any of the languages that it supports. How to create an SDK from Amadeus OpenAPI specification If you are not familiar with the OpenAPI Generator, the following tutorial may help you get started. We will take Ruby as an example and show you the steps to create a turnkey SDK based on the specification for your required Amadeus API. We will use the City Search API in our example. Step 1. Setting up the OpenAPI Generator Information The current stable release version of the OpenAPI Generator at the time of writing this document is 6.0.1. There are many ways to set up the OpenAPI Generator. To eliminate the need for any system dependencies, we will run the OpenAPI Generator as a Docker container. As a prerequisite to this, we need to install the Docker Desktop on our host and start running it. Step 2. Downloading the OpenAPI specification for the City Search API Navigate to the Amadeus OpenAPI Specification and download the JSON file for the City Search API specification . Information You can use both JSON and YAML files with the OpenAPI Generator. Step 3. Creating the Ruby SDK for the City Search API Information The docker run command uses the openapi-generator-cli image: https://hub.docker.com/r/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the City Search API specification and run the following command: 1 2 3 4 5 docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby This command uses the CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json as input ( -i ) located in the current directory ( /local/ ). It generates ( -g ) a Ruby SDK (indicated by ruby ) and outputs ( -o ) the files to folder city_search_ruby , which is located in the current directory ( /local/ ). Step 4. Enabling usage of the Ruby SDK for the City Search API Information Before using the API you will need to get an access token. Please read our Authorization Guide for more information on how to get your token. Navigate to the newly created city_search_ruby folder and open the README.md . This file shows the initial instructions on configuring our Ruby SDK for the City Search API. Follow the instructions in the README.md to build the code into a gem and install it locally by running the following command from the city_search_ruby directory: 1 2 gem build ./openapi_client.gemspec gem install ./openapi_client-1.0.0.gem Information You may need to run this command with administrator privileges ( sudo ). Now we have a full-featured Ruby SDK that is ready for production usage. Step 5. Customising the Ruby SDK for the City Search API There are several ways to customise an SDK created by the OpenAPI Generator: Using a configuration file Using command line arguments Using mustache templates Configuration file There is a number of configuration options that the OpenAPI Generator supports for Ruby . To apply them, we need to create a JSON file with the required parameters and define it when running the OpenAPI Generator. Let's create a file called config.json with the following contents: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 { \"gemName\" : \"Amadeus_City_Search\" , \"gemSummary\" : \"A ruby wrapper for the Amadeus City Search API\" , \"moduleName\" : \"CitySearch\" , \"gemLicense\" : \"MIT\" , \"gemVersion\" : \"0.3.1\" , \"gemRequiredRubyVersion\" : \"2.1\" } To generate an SDK with these custom parameters, put the config.json file into the same directory as the source OpenAPI specification file and run: 1 2 3 4 5 6 docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby \\ -c config.json \\ Command line arguments Instead of using a configuration file, we can specify the custom parameters as additional properties, separated by a comma: 1 2 3 4 5 6 docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby \\ - -additional-properties gemVersion = 0 .3.1,gemName = Amadeus_City_Search You can otherwise specify the parameters directly, for example: 1 --git-user-id openapi-generator-user --git-repo-id AmadeusCitySearch This command will upload the SDK to a repository AmadeusCitySearch by the user called openapi-generator-user . Mustache template To customise the SDK beyond the custom parameters, we can use mustache templates. The GitHub repository of the OpenAPI Generator contains default mustache templates at tree/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/ . For our Ruby Client SDK, we will need the api_client_spec template . Download the template and customise it as required. After that, attach the template to the OpenAPI run command as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby -t <path-to-template-directory> Replace <path-to-template-directory> with the path to the template directory. Step 6. Integrating the Ruby SDK for the City Search API with other libraries Suppose we want to integrate our City Search Ruby SDK into an existing application that already contains many models defined in third-party libraries. One of these models may contain a model whose name is the same as in our City Search Ruby SDK. A solution to this is to add a prefix to all models generated by OpenAPI Generator using the --model-name-prefix setting. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 docker run --rm \\ -v ${ PWD } :/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\ -i /local/CitySearch_v1_swagger_specification.json \\ -g ruby --model-name-prefix Amadeus \\ -o /local/city_search_ruby In this way, all models in our SDK will be prefixed with Amadeus , e.g. AmadeusComponent . Conclusion In this tutorial we have seen how easy it is to generate a basic SDK from our API specification files using the OpenAPI Generator. We took Ruby as an example, but the OpenAPI Generator supports many other languages , so you can easily find a solution that meets your requirements.","title":"Using OpenAPI Generator"},{"location":"sdks/openapi-generator/#generating-sdks-from-amadeus-openapi-specification-using-the-openapi-generator","text":"The OpenAPI Generator is an open-source project for generating REST API clients, server stubs, documentation and schemas based on the OpenAPI specification.
