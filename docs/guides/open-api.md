# OpenAPI

Amadeus for Developers provides a set of Self-Service APIs which was implemented
with the approach API first, so we provide the API specification in OpenAPI format
before any implementation. 

## What is OpenAPI?

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, 
programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, 
which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand 
the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, 
additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic.
