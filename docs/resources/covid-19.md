# COVID-19 and Travel Safety 


"Can I travel to South Korea? Thailand? or Costa Rica? Do I need to have a PCR test? before the flight? after I arrive? How many days of quarantine are required? Where can I find this information?" 

Don't worry, with Amadeus Self-Service APIs, you will be able to get detailed information on **number of COVID-19 cases, entry requirements, safety scores and a lot more** with some extra data about the searched destination using just one single API.

And even more, **safety information** can be retrieved for the destination you would like to visit so that you will be aware of where you are heading to. 

There are two APIs to get this information, which we have grouped into the **COVID-19 and Travel Safety** category.

!!! information
    Our catalogue of [Self-Service APIs](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service){:target="\_blank"} is currently organised by categories that are different to what you see on this page.

## Search by an area

### Travel Restrictions

[Travel Restrictions API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/covid-19-and-travel-safety/api-doc/travel-restrictions){:target="\_blank"} can be searched **by a country** and narrowed down to a city, if required.

The ISO country code is the only mandatory query parameter:

```bash
curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/duty-of-care/diseases/covid19-area-report?countryCode=FR
```

The IATA city code is an optional query parameter to use with the mandatory query parameter:

```bash
curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/duty-of-care/diseases/covid19-area-report?countryCode=FR&cityCode=PAR
```

!!! information
    The country code (2 letters) is defined by [ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2){:target="\_blank"} and the city code (3 letters) is defined by [IATA](https://www.iata.org/en/publications/directories/code-search/){:target="\_blank"}. You can also use [Airport & City Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air){:target="\_blank"} to get this information. 

The results can be requested in different languages by passing the ISO language code as an optional query parameter `language`.

```bash
curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/duty-of-care/diseases/covid19-area-report?countryCode=FR&cityCode=PAR&language=FR
```

The following languages are currently supported: 

* EN - English
* ES - Spanish

* JA - Japanese
* KO - Korean
* TH - Thai
* ID - Bahasa
* ZH - Chinese
* FR - French

### Safe Place

[Safe Place API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/covid-19-and-travel-safety/api-doc/safe-place){:target="\_blank"} can be searched by a given location using:

* Latitude, longitude and optionally a radius
* Square information (North, West, South, and East
* Amadeus location Id

Each of these options has a dedicated endpoint.

#### Latitude/longitude/radius

Latitude and longitude are mandatory query parameters:

```bash
curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/safety/safety-rated-locations?latitude=48.856614&longitude=2.3522219&radius=2
```

Radius (in km) is an optional parameter that can be used to narrow down the search by latitude and longitude:

```bash
curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/safety/safety-rated-locations?latitude=48.856614&longitude=2.3522219&radius=2
```

!!! information
    This endpoint supports [pagination](/pagination.md). 

#### Square information

The square information is define by four mandatory query parameters:

* Latitude north of bounding box
* Longitude west of bounding box 
* Latitude south of bounding box
* Longitude east of bounding box

```bash
curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/safety/safety-rated-locations/by-square?north=41.397158&west=2.160873&south=41.394582&east=2.177181
```

!!! information
    This endpoint supports [pagination](/pagination.md). 

#### Location Id

The location Id is an Amdeus-defined identifier that you can see in the search results when queritung the [Safe Place API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/covid-19-and-travel-safety/api-doc/safe-place){:target="\_blank"} by latitude/longitude/radius or square information. You can then use this Id as a shortcut to query the [Safe Place API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/covid-19-and-travel-safety/api-doc/safe-place){:target="\_blank"} for a specific location:


```bash
curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/safety/safety-rated-locations/Q930400878
```

!!! information 
    The search by Id was designed to target a specific area that you want to focus on.


## Get information from responses
Let's highlight some information that you'll get from both Travel Restrictions API and Safe Place API. 

!!! Warning
    Don't forget that Amadeus for Developers provides a `Test Environment` with [limited data collections](https://amadeus4dev.github.io/developer-guides/guides/api-data-collection/){:target="\_blank"}. 

!!! information
   - the data for Travel Restrictions API comes from [Riskline](https://riskline.com/){:target="\_blank"} and it has been sourced from local governments and media. The quantity of information provided may vary from country to country. 
   - the data for Safe Place API comes from [GeoSure](https://geosureglobal.com/){:target="\_blank"} GeoSafeScores algorithm, which analyzes crime, health and economic data, official travel alerts, local reporting, and a variety of other sources. 
 

### Get summary of the destination + Safety score

From the response of [Travel Restrictions API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/covid-19-and-travel-safety/api-doc/travel-restrictions){:target="\_blank"}: 

```json
"area": {
      "name": "South Korea",
      "code": "KR",
      "areaType": "Country"
    },
    "summary": {
      "lastUpdate": "2022-05-25",
      "text": "<p>Authorities have relied on gathering limits and social distancing measures to contain outbreaks since the start of the pandemic. A new spike in COVID-19 cases led to rises in deaths and those with severe symptoms, and threatened hospital bed and ICU availabilities in late November 2021. While daily new case numbers have reached a record high of over 500,000 in mid-March, reductions in deaths and severe cases have prompted authorities to gradually lift most restrictions. Measures are unlikely to re-tighten in the near-term as the new incoming President Yoon won the recent election while criticising the harshness of previous restrictions.</p>"
    },
    "diseaseRiskLevel": {
      "text": "Medium"
    },
    "diseaseInfection": {
      "lastUpdate": "2022-05-22",
      "level": "Extreme",
      "rate": 785.41,
      "trend": "Decrease"
    }
```

If you include a city in the search query, the response will include the `subAreas` array. This array includes the `area` object describing the city with its name, IATA code, geocoordinates, area type and a summary. The disease risk level is shown specifically for the city. The disease infection rate, however, is shown on the country level. For NYC in US, this would be:

```json
"subAreas": [
      {
        "area": {
          "name": "New York",
          "code": "NYC",
          "geoCode": {
            "latitude": 40.7306,
            "longitude": -73.9865
          },
          "areaType": "City"
        },
        "summary": {
          "text": "<p>The counties comprising the New York City metro area (Bronx, Dutchess, Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Putnam, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester) report plateauing numbers of COVID-19 cases through the beginning of May​.</p> <p>Staff shortages have led to periodic shutdowns of multiple New York City Subway lines.</p>"
        },
        "diseaseRiskLevel": {
          "text": "Medium"
        },
        "relatedArea": [
          {
            "methods": [
              "GET"
            ],
            "rel": "Child"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```


From the response of Safe Place API, you will get an overall safety score and scores for six-component categories: 

- Women’s Safety 
- Health & Medical Safety 
- Physical Harm 
- Theft 
- Political Freedoms 
- LGBTQ+ Safety 

```json
            "subType": "CITY",
            "name": "Seoul",
            "geoCode": {
                "latitude": 37.566534999999995,
                "longitude": 126.97796899999999
            },
            "safetyScores": {
                "lgbtq": 45,
                "medical": 45,
                "overall": 35,
                "physicalHarm": 33,
                "politicalFreedom": 28,
                "theft": 44,
                "women": 34
            }
        }
```

**Safety scores range on a scale of 1-100, with 1 being the safest and 100 being the least safe.** In this example of Seoul, South Korea, a “politicalFreedom” score of 28 indicates that the potential for infringement of political rights or political unrest is less likely to happen at this location.  

Each location found by the [Safe Place API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/covid-19-and-travel-safety/api-doc/safe-place){:target="\_blank"} is shown with its Amadeus location Id, which can be used in subsequent search queries:

```json
"type": "safety-rated-location",
      "id": "Q930402720"
```

### Get COVID-19 related statistics 

From the response of Travel Restrictions API: the result provides COVID-19 statistics such as total cases, active cases, and the current rate of infection per 100,000, including the data sources: 

```json
