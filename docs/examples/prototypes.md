# Prototypes 

Would you like to explore the applications that you could build with Amadeus Self-Service APIs?
We have prototypes available in [Amadeus for Developers GitHub](https://github.com/amadeus4dev).

There are two types of prototypes (demo apps) available. 

* [Amadeus official prototype](#amadeus-official-prototypes-or-demo-apps) are managed by Amadeus for Developers team and updated frequently to the latest version of APIs and SDKs. 
* [Community prototypes](#prototypes-from-community) are examples or demo apps that have been built and managed by developer community and it is not supported or maintained by Amadeus for Developers team.
