# How to contribute

First of all, I am so glad that you are reading this right now, we need YOU to make [Amadeus for developers documentation](https://amadeus4dev.github.io/developer-guides/) more consistent, and readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, or/and fixing typos. :heart_eyes::tada: Thank you! 


### Did you find a typo or misleading information? 
- Open up a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/developer-guides/issues) with descriptions of which sections and the reasons if necessary. 


### Do you have an idea or/and contents to contribute? 
There are 2 ways for you to contribute by spreading your ideas!  
1. **(Recommended)** Make changes directly to [the source code in GitHub](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/developer-guides), and then open a pull request to apply your changes to the main branch. In this case, you will be able to contribute with your own words and contents directly. Check below about the documentation navigation so that you know which folders/files to update. 
2. Open up a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/developer-guides/issues) with descritions of your ideas and contents. 


### Documentation Navigation

The Amadeus for Developers Documentation is generated with [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). so each page in the documentation is based on Markdown and [mkdocs.yml file](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/developer-guides/blob/dcd481558da870a539a49f5564e8cb4e5e159835/mkdocs.yml) has the navigation indicating which section is with which file. for example, API Tutorials > Flights section is with [resources/flights.md](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/developer-guides/blob/dcd481558da870a539a49f5564e8cb4e5e159835/docs/resources/flights.md)

### Do you just have a question? 
Please feel free to join [our Discord channel](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/developer-guides/blob/dcd481558da870a539a49f5564e8cb4e5e159835/mkdocs.yml) to meet our community and ask questions! 

Thank you! :heart::airplane: Happy Travel, Happy Coding
