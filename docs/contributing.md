# How to contribute

First of all, I am so glad that you are reading this right now, we need YOU to make [Amadeus for developers documentation](https://amadeus4dev.github.io/developer-guides/) more consistent, readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors or/and fixing typos. :heart_eyes::tada: Thank you! 


### Did you find a typo or misleading information?

### Do you have an idea or/and content to contribute ? 
There are 2 ways for you to contribute by spreading your ideas!  
1. **(Recommended)** Make changes to [the source code in GitHub](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/developer-guides), and then open a pull request to apply your changes to the main branch.In this case, you will be able to provide your own words and contents directly.
